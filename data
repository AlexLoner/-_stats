However, the fundamental mechanism responsible for the near-unity quantum efficiency of this process is unknown. Here we elucidate the role of coherence in determining the efficiency of charge separation in the plant photosystem II reaction centre by comprehensively combining experiment (two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy) and theory (Redfield theory). We reveal the presence of electronic coherence between excitons as well as between exciton and charge-transfer states that we argue to be maintained by vibrational modes. Furthermore, we present evidence for the strong correlation between the degree of electronic coherence and efficient and ultrafast charge separation. We propose that this coherent mechanism will inspire the development of new energy technologies.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27566821@NATURE_PHYSICS

Such systems can be used to create synthetic materials with properties that cannot be attained in materials having only loss or only gain. Here we report PT-symmetry breaking in coupled optical resonators. We observed non-reciprocity in the PT-symmetry-breaking phase due to strong field localization, which significantly enhances nonlinearity. In the linear regime, light transmission is reciprocal regardless of whether the symmetry is broken or unbroken. We show that in one direction there is a complete absence of resonance peaks whereas in the other direction the transmission is resonantly enhanced, a feature directly associated with the use of resonant structures. Our results could lead to a new generation of synthetic optical systems enabling on-chip manipulation and control of light propagation.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=22074068@NATURE_PHYSICS

Of particular interest are topological defects between the two commensurate phases, such as solitons and domain walls. Here we report a commensurate–incommensurate transition for graphene on top of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Depending on the rotation angle between the lattices of the two crystals, graphene can either stretch to adapt to a slightly different hBN periodicity (for small angles, resulting in a commensurate state) or exhibit little adjustment (the incommensurate state). In the commensurate state, areas with matching lattice constants are separated by domain walls that accumulate the generated strain. Such soliton-like objects are not only of significant fundamental interest, but their presence could also explain recent experiments where electronic and optical properties of graphene-hBN heterostructures were observed to be considerably altered.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24052531@NATURE_PHYSICS

A manifestation of these many-body interactions is the formation of excitons, bound electron–hole pairs, but higher-order excitonic states are also possible. Here we demonstrate the existence of four-body, biexciton states in monolayer WSe2. The biexciton is identified as a sharply defined state in photoluminescence at high exciton density. Its binding energy of 52 meV is more than an order of magnitude greater than that found in conventional quantum-well structures7. A variational calculation of the biexciton state reveals that the high binding energy arises not only from strong carrier confinement, but also from reduced and non-local dielectric screening. These results open the way for the creation of new correlated excitonic states linking the degenerate valleys in TMDC crystals, as well as more complex many-body states such as exciton condensates or the recently reported dropletons8.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24724126@NATURE_PHYSICS

Although single-particle and excitonic phenomena related to spin–valley coupling have been extensively studied1,3,4,5,6, the effects of spin–valley coupling on collective quantum phenomena remain less well understood. Here we report the observation of superconducting monolayer NbSe2 with an in-plane upper critical field of more than six times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, by means of magnetotransport measurements. The effect can be interpreted in terms of the competing Zeeman effect and large intrinsic spin–orbit interactions in non-centrosymmetric NbSe2 monolayers, where the electron spin is locked to the out-of-plane direction. Our results provide strong evidence of unconventional Ising pairing protected by spin–momentum locking, and suggest further studies of non-centrosymmetric superconductivity with unique spin and valley degrees of freedom in the two-dimensional limit.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31855051@NATURE_PHYSICS

Here, we report on the observation of chiral Meissner currents in bosonic ladders exposed to a strong artificial magnetic field. By suddenly decoupling the individual ladders and projecting into isolated double wells, we are able to measure the currents on each side of the ladder. For large coupling strengths along the rungs of the ladder, we find a saturated maximum chiral current, which is analogous to the surface currents in the Meissner effect. Below a critical inter-leg coupling strength, the chiral current decreases in good agreement with our expectations for a vortex lattice phase. Our realization of a low-dimensional Meissner-like effect and spin–orbit coupling in one dimension opens the path to exploring interacting particles in low dimensions exposed to a uniform magnetic field.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24609566@NATURE_PHYSICS

Topological semimetals with massless relativistic electrons have also been predicted2 as three-dimensional analogues of graphene3. These systems are known as Weyl semimetals, and are predicted to have a range of exotic transport properties and surface states4,5,6,7, distinct from those of topological insulators8,9. Here we examine the magneto-transport properties of NbP, a material the band structure of which has been predicted to combine the hallmarks of a Weyl semimetal10,11 with those of a normal semimetal. We observe an extremely large magnetoresistance of 850,000% at 1.85 K (250% at room temperature) in a magnetic field of up to 9 T, without any signs of saturation, and an ultrahigh carrier mobility of 5 × 106 cm2 V−1 s−1 that accompanied by strong Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations. NbP therefore presents a unique example of a material combining topological and conventional electronic phases, with intriguing physical properties resulting from their interplay.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24526712@NATURE_PHYSICS

This raises questions about the objectivity of the second law: does it depend, for example, on what we know about the system? For over a century, much effort has been devoted to incorporating information into thermodynamics and assessing the entropic and energetic costs of manipulating information. More recently, this historically theoretical pursuit has become relevant in practical situations where information is manipulated at small scales, such as in molecular and cell biology, artificial nano-devices or quantum computation. Here we give an introduction to a novel theoretical framework for the thermodynamics of information based on stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems, review some recent experimental results, and present an overview of the state of the art in the field.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27987858@NATURE_PHYSICS

Magnons are the quanta of spin waves: the dynamic eigen-excitations of a magnetically ordered body. Analogous to electric currents, magnon-based currents can be used to carry, transport and process information. The use of magnons allows the implementation of novel wave-based computing technologies free from the drawbacks inherent to modern electronics, such as dissipation of energy due to Ohmic losses. Logic circuits based on wave interference and nonlinear wave interaction can be designed with much smaller footprints compared with conventional electron-based logic circuits. In this review, after an introduction into the basic properties of magnons and their handling, we discuss the inter-conversion between magnon currents and electron-carried spin and charge currents; and concepts and experimental studies of magnon-based computing circuits.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24418002@NATURE_PHYSICS

The inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin zone could be selectively addressed using circularly polarized light fields3,4,5, suggesting the possibility for magneto-optical measurement and manipulation of the valley pseudospin degree of freedom 6,7,8. Here we report such experiments that demonstrate the valley Zeeman effect—strongly anisotropic lifting of the degeneracy of the valley pseudospin degree of freedom using an external magnetic field. The valley-splitting measured using the exciton transition deviates appreciably from values calculated using a three-band tight-binding model9 for an independent electron–hole pair at ±K valleys. We show, on the other hand, that a theoretical model taking into account the strongly bound nature of the exciton yields an excellent agreement with the experimentally observed splitting. In contrast to the exciton, the trion transition exhibits an unexpectedly large valley Zeeman effect that cannot be understood within the same framework, hinting at a different contribution to the trion magnetic moment. Our results raise the possibility of controlling the valley degree of freedom using magnetic fields in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides or observing topological states of photons strongly coupled to elementary optical excitations in a microcavity10.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24521164@NATURE_PHYSICS

However, a complete synergy between superconducting and magnetic orders turns out to be possible through the creation of spin-triplet Cooper pairs, which are generated at carefully engineered superconductor interfaces with ferromagnetic materials. Currently, there is intense activity focused on identifying materials combinations that merge superconductivity and spintronics to enhance device functionality and performance. The results look promising: it has been shown, for example, that superconducting order can greatly enhance central effects in spintronics such as spin injection and magnetoresistance. Here, we review the experimental and theoretical advances in this field and provide an outlook for upcoming challenges in superconducting spintronics.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24505490@NATURE_PHYSICS

It is a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum anomaly1,2 in relativistic field theory of chiral fermions (massless spin 1/2 particles with a definite projection of spin on momentum)—a remarkable phenomenon arising from a collective motion of particles and antiparticles in the Dirac sea. The recent discovery3,4,5,6 of Dirac semimetals with chiral quasiparticles opens a fascinating possibility to study this phenomenon in condensed matter experiments. Here we report on the measurement of magnetotransport in zirconium pentatelluride, ZrTe5, that provides strong evidence for the chiral magnetic effect. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments show that this material’s electronic structure is consistent with a three-dimensional Dirac semimetal. We observe a large negative magnetoresistance when the magnetic field is parallel with the current. The measured quadratic field dependence of the magnetoconductance is a clear indication of the chiral magnetic effect. The observed phenomenon stems from the effective transmutation of a Dirac semimetal into a Weyl semimetal induced by parallel electric and magnetic fields that represent a topologically non-trivial gauge field background. We expect that the chiral magnetic effect may emerge in a wide class of materials that are near the transition between the trivial and topological insulators.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27051875@NATURE_PHYSICS

These degrees of freedom are the real electron spin, the layer pseudospin, and the valley pseudospin. New methods for the quantum control of the spin and these pseudospins arise from the existence of Berry phase-related physical properties and strong spin–orbit coupling. The former leads to the versatile control of the valley pseudospin, whereas the latter gives rise to an interplay between the spin and the pseudospins.

Weyl proposed that the massless solution of the Dirac equation represents a pair of a new type of particles, the so-called Weyl fermions1. However, their existence in particle physics remains elusive after more than eight decades. Recently, significant advances in both topological insulators and topological semimetals have provided an alternative way to realize Weyl fermions in condensed matter, as an emergent phenomenon: when two non-degenerate bands in the three-dimensional momentum space cross in the vicinity of the Fermi energy (called Weyl nodes), the low-energy excitations behave exactly as Weyl fermions. Here we report the direct observation in TaAs of the long-sought-after Weyl nodes by performing bulk-sensitive soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. The projected locations at the nodes on the (001) surface match well to the Fermi arcs, providing undisputable experimental evidence for the existence of Weyl fermionic quasiparticles in TaAs.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=25242940@NATURE_PHYSICS

A striking manifestation of this transverse transport was then revealed in the quantum Hall effect2 where the plateaux depicted by the Hall conductivity were attributed to a topological invariant characterizing the Bloch bands: the Chern number3. Until now, topological transport associated with non-zero Chern numbers has only been observed in electronic systems2,4,5. Here we use the transverse deflection of an atomic cloud in response to an optical gradient to measure the Chern number of artificially generated Hofstadter bands6. These topological bands are very flat and thus constitute good candidates for the realization of fractional Chern insulators7. Combining these deflection measurements with the determination of the band populations, we obtain an experimental value for the Chern number of the lowest band νexp = 0.99(5). This first Chern-number measurement in a non-electronic system is facilitated by an all-optical artificial gauge field scheme, generating uniform flux in optical superlattices.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24609580@NATURE_PHYSICS

Although group 6 TMDs, such as MX2 with M = (Mo, W) and X = (S, Se, Te), can exist in several polymorphs3, most studies have been conducted with the semiconducting hexagonal (2H) phase as other polymorphs often exhibit inhomogeneous formation1,4,5,6. Here, we report a reversible structural phase transition between the hexagonal and stable monoclinic (distorted octahedral or 1T′) phases in bulk single-crystalline MoTe2. Furthermore, an electronic phase transition from semimetallic to semiconducting is shown as 1T′-MoTe2 crystals go from bulk to few-layered. Bulk 1T′-MoTe2 crystals exhibit a maximum carrier mobility of 4,000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a giant magnetoresistance of 16,000% in a magnetic field of 14 T at 1.8 K. In the few-layered form, 1T′-MoTe2 exhibits a bandgap opening of up to 60 meV, which our density functional theory calculations identify as arising from strong interband spin–orbit coupling. We further clarify that the Peierls distortion is a key mechanism to stabilize the monoclinic structure. This class of semiconducting MoTe2 unlocks the possibility of topological quantum devices based on non-trivial Z2-band-topology quantum spin Hall insulators in monoclinic TMDs (ref. 7).@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24601409@NATURE_PHYSICS
2014@Броадхурст Т|Чюех Т|Щиве Х Ю|@Cosmic structure quantum interference coherent dark wave@130@The conventional cold-particle interpretation of dark matter (known as ‘cold dark matter’, or CDM) still lacks laboratory support and struggles with the basic properties of common dwarf galaxies, which have surprisingly uniform central masses and shallow density profiles1,2,3,4,5. In contrast, galaxies predicted by CDM extend to much lower masses, with steeper, singular profiles6,7,8,9. This tension motivates cold, wavelike dark matter (ψDM) composed of a non-relativistic Bose–Einstein condensate, so the uncertainty principle counters gravity below a Jeans scale10,11,12. Here we achieve cosmological simulations of this quantum state at unprecedentedly high resolution capable of resolving dwarf galaxies, with only one free parameter, mB, the boson mass. We demonstrate the large-scale structure is indistinguishable from CDM, as desired, but differs radically inside galaxies where quantum interference forms solitonic cores surrounded by extended haloes of fluctuating density granules. These results allow us to determine  eV using stellar phase-space distributions in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Denser, more massive solitons are predicted for Milky Way sized galaxies, providing a substantial seed to help explain early spheroid formation. The onset of galaxy formation is substantially delayed relative to CDM, appearing at redshift z ≲ 13 in our simulations.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24712232@NATURE_PHYSICS

And how do these systems thermalize, given that they comprise so many degrees of freedom? Progress in answering these—and related—questions has accelerated in recent years—a trend that can be partially attributed to success with experiments performing quantum simulations using ultracold atoms and trapped ions. Here we provide an overview of this progress, specifically in studies probing dynamical equilibration and thermalization of systems driven out of equilibrium by quenches, ramps and periodic driving. In doing so, we also address topics such as the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, typicality, transport, many-body localization and universality near phase transitions, as well as future prospects for quantum simulation.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24529250@NATURE_PHYSICS

Here, we reveal a family of homotypic silicon vacancy defects in silicon carbide exhibiting attractive spin properties. In particular, the defect spins can be initialized and read out even at room temperature by means of optically detected magnetic resonance, suggesting appealing applications such as spin qubits and spin magnetometers. Using this technique we detect two-quantum spin resonances, providing strong evidence for the
S = 3/2 ground state of the silicon vacancy defects. The optically induced population inversion of these high-spin ground states leads to stimulated microwave emission, which we directly observed in our silicon carbide crystals.

The efficiency of the conversion is described by the spin Hall angle (SHA). The SHA can most readily be inferred by using the generated spin currents to excite or rotate the magnetization of ferromagnetic films or nano-elements via spin-transfer torques. Some of the largest spin-torque-derived spin Hall angles (ST-SHA) have been reported in platinum. Here we show, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements, that the transparency of the Pt–ferromagnet interface to the spin current plays a central role in determining the magnitude of the ST-SHA. We measure a much larger ST-SHA in Pt/cobalt (∼0.11) compared to Pt/permalloy (∼0.05) bilayers when the interfaces are assumed to be completely transparent. Taking into account the transparency of these interfaces, as derived from spin-mixing conductances, we find that the intrinsic SHA in platinum has a much higher value of 0.19 ± 0.04 as compared to the ST-SHA. The importance of the interface transparency is further exemplified by the insertion of atomically thin magnetic layers at the Pt/permalloy interface that we show strongly modulates the magnitude of the ST-SHA.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24423071@NATURE_PHYSICS

One of the most distinct electronic transport signatures predicted for such topological surface states (TSS) is a well-defined half-integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) in a magnetic field, where the surface Hall conductivities become quantized in units of (1/2)e2/h (e being the electron charge, h the Planck constant) concomitant with vanishing resistance. Here, we observe a well-developed QHE arising from TSS in an intrinsic TI of BiSbTeSe2. Our samples exhibit surface-dominated conduction even close to room temperature, whereas the bulk conduction is negligible. At low temperatures and high magnetic fields perpendicular to the top and bottom surfaces, we observe well-developed integer quantized Hall plateaux, where the two parallel surfaces each contribute a half-integer e2/h quantized Hall conductance, accompanied by vanishing longitudinal resistance. When the bottom surface is gated to match the top surface in carrier density, only odd integer QH plateaux are observed, representing a half-integer QHE of two degenerate Dirac gases.

By studying correlations we find that the device performance is inconsistent with classical annealing or that it is governed by classical spin dynamics.

Bond-directional interactions1,2,3 offer a novel alternative to Heisenberg exchange and provide the building blocks of the Kitaev model4, which has a quantum spin liquid as its exact ground state. Honeycomb iridates, A2IrO3 (A = Na, Li), offer potential realizations of the Kitaev magnetic exchange coupling, and their reported magnetic behaviour may be interpreted within the Kitaev framework. However, the extent of their relevance to the Kitaev model remains unclear, as evidence for bond-directional interactions has so far been indirect. Here we present direct evidence for dominant bond-directional interactions in antiferromagnetic Na2IrO3 and show that they lead to strong magnetic frustration. Diffuse magnetic X-ray scattering reveals broken spin-rotational symmetry even above the Néel temperature, with the three spin components exhibiting short-range correlations along distinct crystallographic directions. This spin- and real-space entanglement directly uncovers the bond-directional nature of these interactions, thus providing a direct connection between honeycomb iridates and Kitaev physics.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24429458@NATURE_PHYSICS

Even within a closed quantum system, subsystems usually thermalize using the rest of the system as a heat bath. Exceptions to quantum thermalization have been observed, but typically require inherent symmetries1,2 or noninteracting particles in the presence of static disorder3,4,5,6. However, for strong interactions and high excitation energy there are cases, known as many-body localization (MBL), where disordered quantum systems can fail to thermalize7,8,9,10. We experimentally generate MBL states by applying an Ising Hamiltonian with long-range interactions and programmable random disorder to ten spins initialized far from equilibrium. Using experimental and numerical methods we observe the essential signatures of MBL: initial-state memory retention, Poissonian distributed energy level spacings, and evidence of long-time entanglement growth.

Nevertheless, bulk FeSe itself remains an unusual case when compared with pnictogen-based iron superconductors, and may hold clues to understanding the more exotic derivatives of the FeSe system. The FeSe phase diagram is distinct from the pnictides: the orthorhombic distortion, which is likely to be of a ‘spin-nematic’ nature in numerous pnictides, is not accompanied by magnetic order in FeSe, and the superconducting transition temperature Tc rises significantly with pressure before decreasing. Here we show that the magnetic interactions in FeSe, as opposed to most pnictides, demonstrate an unusual and unanticipated frustration, which suppresses magnetic (but not nematic) order, triggers ferro-orbital order in the nematic phase and can naturally explain the non-monotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting critical temperature Tc(P).@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=28200721@NATURE_PHYSICS

a) had been proposed as an alternative strongly interacting Bose system1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, experimental progress9,10,11,12 has been limited by its short lifetime. Here we present time-resolved measurements of the momentum distribution of a Bose-condensed gas that is suddenly jumped to unitarity, where . Contrary to expectation, we observe that the gas lives long enough to permit the momentum to evolve to a quasi-steady-state distribution, consistent with universality, while remaining degenerate. Investigations of the time evolution of this unitary Bose gas may lead to a deeper understanding of quantum many-body physics."@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=22077055@NATURE_PHYSICS

In bulk NbSe2 a CDW sets in at TCDW = 33 K and superconductivity sets in at Tc = 7.2 K. Below Tc these electronic states coexist but their microscopic formation mechanisms remain controversial. Here we present an electronic characterization study of a single two-dimensional (2D) layer of NbSe2 by means of low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and electrical transport measurements. We demonstrate that 3 × 3 CDW order in NbSe2 remains intact in two dimensions. Superconductivity also still remains in the 2D limit, but its onset temperature is depressed to 1.9 K. Our STS measurements at 5 K reveal a CDW gap of Δ = 4 meV at the Fermi energy, which is accessible by means of STS owing to the removal of bands crossing the Fermi level for a single layer. Our observations are consistent with the simplified (compared to bulk) electronic structure of single-layer NbSe2, thus providing insight into CDW formation and superconductivity in this model strongly correlated system.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27009908@NATURE_PHYSICS

These organelles play key biological roles, by compartmentalizing the cell to enable spatiotemporal control of biological reactions. Recent studies suggest that membrane-less intracellular compartments are multicomponent viscous liquid droplets that form via phase separation. Proteins that have an intrinsic tendency for being conformationally heterogeneous seem to be the main drivers of liquid–liquid phase separation in the cell. These findings highlight the relevance of classical concepts from the physics of polymeric phase transitions for understanding the assembly of intracellular membrane-less compartments.

Could quantum criticality theory be more relevant in the corresponding case of quantum paraelectrics on the border of ferroelectricity?  To address this question we have investigated the temperature dependence of the dielectric function of the displacive quantum paraelectrics SrTiO3, oxygen-18 substituted SrTiO3 and KTaO3. In all of these materials on the border of ferroelectricity we observe non-classical T2 temperature dependencies of the inverse dielectric function below 50 K, followed by anomalous upturns below a few kelvin extending into the millikelvin range. This non-classical behaviour can be understood quantitatively without adjustable parameters in terms of quantum criticality theory when extended to include the effects of long-range dipolar interactions and the coupling of the electric polarization field with acoustic phonons. The quantum critical regime in displacive ferroelectrics is thus strikingly different from that in the better-known ferromagnetic counterparts and offers unexpected prospects in the field of quantum phase transitions.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=22243309@NATURE_PHYSICS

However, the absence of strong low-frequency magnetic fluctuations near or above the transition has been interpreted as implying the primacy of orbital ordering. In contrast, we establish that quantum fluctuations of spin-1 local moments with strongly frustrated exchange interactions can lead to a nematic quantum paramagnetic phase consistent with the observations in FeSe. We show that this phase is a fundamental expression of the existence of a Berry’s phase associated with the topological defects of a Néel antiferromagnet, in a manner analogous to that which gives rise to valence bond crystal order for spin-1/2 systems.

Although robust spin and valley degrees of freedom are inferred from polarized photoluminescence (PL) experiments4,5,6,7,8, PL timescales are necessarily constrained by short-lived (3–100 ps) electron–hole recombination9,10. Direct probes of spin/valley polarization dynamics of resident carriers in electron (or hole)-doped TMDCs, which may persist long after recombination ceases, are at an early stage11,12,13. Here we directly measure the coupled spin–valley dynamics in electron-doped MoS2 and WS2 monolayers using optical Kerr spectroscopy, and reveal very long electron spin lifetimes, exceeding 3 ns at 5 K (two to three orders of magnitude longer than typical exciton recombination times). In contrast with conventional III–V or II–VI semiconductors, spin relaxation accelerates rapidly in small transverse magnetic fields. Supported by a model of coupled spin–valley dynamics, these results indicate a novel mechanism of itinerant electron spin dephasing in the rapidly fluctuating internal spin–orbit field in TMDCs, driven by fast inter-valley scattering. Additionally, a long-lived spin coherence is observed at lower energies, commensurate with localized states.

The Weibel instability is one candidate mechanism for the generation of sufficiently strong fields to create a collisionless shock. Despite their crucial role in astrophysical systems, observation of the magnetic fields produced by Weibel instabilities in experiments has been challenging. Using a proton probe to directly image electromagnetic fields, we present evidence of Weibel-generated magnetic fields that grow in opposing, initially unmagnetized plasma flows from laser-driven laboratory experiments. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations reveal that the instability efficiently extracts energy from the plasma flows, and that the self-generated magnetic energy reaches a few percent of the total energy in the system.

In particular, their non-zero topological charge leads to a predicted ‘skyrmion Hall effect’, in which current-driven skyrmions acquire a transverse velocity component analogous to charged particles in the conventional Hall effect. Here, we use nanoscale pump–probe imaging to reveal the real-time dynamics of skyrmions driven by current-induced spin–orbit torques. We find that skyrmions move at a well-defined angle ΘSkH that can exceed 30° with respect to the current flow, but in contrast to conventional theoretical expectations, ΘSkH increases linearly with velocity up to at least 100 ms−1.

The momentum-resolved nature of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) makes it a powerful tool to characterize spectral gaps. ARPES has been instrumental in establishing the anisotropic d-wave structure of the superconducting gap in high-transition-temperature (Tc) cuprates, which is different from the conventional isotropic s-wave superconducting gap. Shortly afterwards, ARPES demonstrated that an anomalous gap above Tc, often termed the pseudogap, follows a similar anisotropy. The nature of this poorly understood pseudogap and its relationship with superconductivity has since become the focal point of research in the field. To address this issue, the momentum, temperature, doping and materials dependence of spectral gaps have been extensively examined with significantly improved instrumentation and carefully matched experiments in recent years. This article overviews the current understanding and unresolved issues of the basic phenomenology of gap hierarchy. We show how ARPES has been sensitive to phase transitions, has distinguished between orders having distinct broken electronic symmetries, and has uncovered rich momentum- and temperature-dependent fingerprints reflecting an intertwined and competing relationship between the ordered states and superconductivity that results in multiple phenomenologically distinct ground states inside the superconducting dome.

The extensively discussed s+− symmetry appears when contributions from all orbitals have equal sign, whereas a novel orbital-antiphase s+− symmetry emerges when the xy orbital has an opposite sign to the xz and yz orbitals.

Comparing both techniques reveals a growing discrepancy between the finite 2Δ and the threshold energy for electromagnetic absorption, which vanishes critically towards the superconductor–insulator transition. We identify the excess absorption below 2Δ as strong evidence of the Higgs mode in two-dimensional quantum critical superconductors.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24020461@NATURE_PHYSICS
2015@Хартнолл С А|@Theory universal incoherent metallic transport@64@The anomalous transport of important materials such as high-temperature superconductors and other ‘bad metals’ is not well understood theoretically. In an incoherent metal, transport is controlled by the collective diffusion of energy and charge rather than by quasiparticle or momentum relaxation. Here, we explore the possibility of a universal bound D ≳ ℏνF2/(kBT) on the underlying diffusion constants in an incoherent metal. Such a bound is loosely motivated by results from holographic duality, the uncertainty principle and measurements of diffusion in strongly interacting non-metallic systems. Metals close to saturating this bound are shown to have a linear-in-temperature resistivity with an underlying dissipative timescale matching that recently deduced from experimental data on a wide range of metals. This bound may therefore be responsible for the ubiquitous appearance of high-temperature regimes in metals with T-linear resistivity. To establish this calls for direct measurements of diffusive processes and of charge susceptibilities in incoherent metals.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24744056@NATURE_PHYSICS

Similar to spin, the valley pseudospin is spanned by a time-reversal pair of states, although the two valley pseudospin states transform to each other under spatial inversion. The breaking of inversion symmetry induces various valley-contrasted physical properties; for instance, valley-dependent topological transport is of both scientific and technological interest2,3,4,5. Bilayer graphene is a unique system whose intrinsic inversion symmetry can be controllably broken by a perpendicular electric field, offering a rare possibility for continuously tunable topological valley transport. We used a perpendicular gate electric field to break the inversion symmetry in bilayer graphene, and a giant nonlocal response was observed as a result of the topological transport of the valley pseudospin. We further showed that the valley transport is fully tunable by external gates, and that the nonlocal signal persists up to room temperature and over long distances. These observations challenge the current understanding of topological valley transport in a gapped system, and the robust topological transport may lead to future valleytronic applications.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26921562@NATURE_PHYSICS

For some systems, singlet fission has been shown to occur on the 100 fs timescale and with a 200% quantum yield, but the mechanism of this process remains uncertain. Here we study a model singlet fission system, TIPS-pentacene, using ultrafast vibronic spectroscopy. We observe that vibrational coherence in the initially photogenerated singlet state is transferred to the triplet state and show that this behaviour is effectively identical to ultrafast internal conversion for polyenes in solution. This similarity in vibronic dynamics suggests that both multi-molecular singlet fission and single-molecular internal conversion are mediated by the same underlying relaxation processes, based on strong coupling between nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. In its most efficient form this leads to a conical intersection between the coupled electronic states.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=28022145@NATURE_PHYSICS

Here we employ capacitance spectroscopy to probe directly the density of states (DoS) and energy gaps in this spectrum. Without a magnetic field, replica spectra are seen as pronounced DoS minima surrounded by van Hove singularities. The Hofstadter butterfly shows up as recurring Landau fan diagrams in high fields. Electron–electron interactions add another twist to the self-similar behaviour. We observe suppression of quantum Hall ferromagnetism, a reverse Stoner transition at commensurable fluxes and additional ferromagnetism within replica spectra.

Here we demonstrate that such conditions are realized in simple bilayer metal films where the spin–orbit interaction and spin-dependent scattering couple the current-induced spin accumulation to the electrical conductivity. We show that the longitudinal resistance of Ta|Co and Pt|Co bilayers changes when reversing the polarity of the current or the sign of the magnetization. This unidirectional magnetoresistance scales linearly with current density and has opposite sign in Ta and Pt, which we associate with the modification of the interface scattering potential induced by the spin Hall effect in these materials.

In all these applications, accessing and maintaining a single-soliton state is a key requirement—one that remains an outstanding challenge.

It has been believed that such ‘fast cooling’ electrons have a power-law distribution in energy with an index −2, and their synchrotron radiation has a photon spectral index1−1.5. On the other hand, in a transient expanding astrophysical source, such as a γ-ray burst (GRB), the magnetic field strength in the emission region continuously decreases with radius. Here we study such a system, and find that in a certain parameter regime, the fast-cooling electrons can have a harder energy spectrum.

In graphene with low disorder, however, the Fermi energy can be tuned to be smaller than the superconducting gap. In this unusual limit, the holes are expected to be reflected specularly at the superconductor–graphene interface owing to the onset of interband Andreev processes, where the effective mass of the reflected holes changes sign4,5.

The transport signature of such surface states is a plateau that arrests the exponential divergence of the insulating bulk with decreasing temperature. This universal behaviour is observed in all TI candidates ranging from Bi2Te2Se to SmB6. Recently, extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) has been reported in several topological semimetals which exhibit TI universal resistivity behaviour only when breaking time reversal symmetry, a regime where TIs theoretically cease to exist. Among these materials, TaAs and NbP are nominated as Weyl semimetals owing to their lack of inversion symmetry, Cd3As2 is known as a Dirac semimetal owing to its linear band crossing at the Fermi level, and WTe2 is termed a resonant compensated semimetal owing to its perfect electron–hole symmetry. Here we introduce LaSb, a simple rock-salt structure material that lacks broken inversion symmetry, perfect linear band crossing, and perfect electron–hole symmetry yet exhibits all the exotic field-induced behaviours of these more complex semimetals. It shows a field-induced universal TI resistivity with a plateau at roughly 15 K, ultrahigh mobility of carriers in the plateau region, quantum oscillations with the angle dependence of a two-dimensional Fermi surface, and XMR of about one million percent at 9 T.

Optical creation of an exciton or a polariton in a two-dimensional electron system embedded in a microcavity constitutes a new frontier for this field due to an interplay between cavity coupling favouring ultralow-mass polariton formation6 and exciton–electron interactions leading to polaron or trion formation7,8.

Here we show that the localized classical spin of a magnetic atom immersed in a superconductor with a two-dimensional electronic band structure gives rise to a long-range coherent magnetic quantum state. We experimentally evidence coherent bound states with spatially oscillating particle–hole asymmetry extending tens of nanometres from individual iron atoms embedded in a 2H–NbSe2 crystal. We theoretically elucidate how reduced dimensionality enhances the spatial extent of these bound states and describe their energy and spatial structure. These spatially extended magnetic states could be used as building blocks for coupling coherently distant magnetic atoms in new topological superconducting phases4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26922140@NATURE_PHYSICS

In the presence of a magnetic field, the maximum supercurrent oscillates3 and each oscillation corresponding to the entry of one Josephson vortex into the barrier4. Josephson vortices are conceptual blocks of advanced quantum devices such as coherent terahertz generators5 or qubits for quantum computing6, in which on-demand generation and control is crucial. Here, we map superconducting correlations inside proximity Josephson junctions7 using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Unexpectedly, we find that such Josephson vortices have real cores, in which the proximity gap is locally suppressed and the normal state recovered. By following the Josephson vortex formation and evolution we demonstrate that they originate from quantum interference of Andreev quasiparticles8, and that the phase portraits of the two superconducting quantum condensates at edges of the junction decide their generation, shape, spatial extent and arrangement. Our observation opens a pathway towards the generation and control of Josephson vortices by applying supercurrents through the superconducting leads of the junctions, that is, by purely electrical means without any need for a magnetic field, which is a crucial step towards high-density on-chip integration of superconducting quantum devices.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24530958@NATURE_PHYSICS

Theory has shown that connecting random networks may very easily result in abrupt failures3,4,5,6. This finding reveals an intriguing paradox7,8: if natural systems organize in interconnected networks, how can they be so stable? Here we provide a solution to this conundrum, showing that the stability of a system of networks relies on the relation between the internal structure of a network and its pattern of connections to other networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that if interconnections are provided by network hubs, and the connections between networks are moderately convergent, the system of networks is stable and robust to failure. We test this theoretical prediction on two independent experiments of functional brain networks (in task and resting states), which show that brain networks are connected with a topology that maximizes stability according to the theory.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24540687@NATURE_PHYSICS

Significant work has been undertaken to attain this left-handed response, such as establishing a negative refractive index in so-called metamaterials, which consist of periodic sub-wavelength structures2,3,4. However, an electronic counterpart has not been demonstrated owing to difficulties in creating repeated structures smaller than the electronic Fermi wavelength of the order ∼10 nm. Here, without needing to engineer sub-wavelength structures, we demonstrate negative refractive behaviour of Dirac fermions in graphene, exploiting its unique relativistic band structure5. Analysis of both electron focusing through an n–p–n flat lens and negative refraction across n–p junctions confirms left-handed behaviour in the electronic system. This approach to electronic optics is of particular relevance to the on-going efforts to develop novel quantum devices with emerging6 layered materials.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26843426@NATURE_PHYSICS

However, this bound needs to be reinterpreted at microscopic scales, where molecular bio-motors2 and some artificial micro-engines3,4,5 operate. As described by stochastic thermodynamics6,7, energy transfers in microscopic systems are random and thermal fluctuations induce transient decreases of entropy, allowing for possible violations of the Carnot limit8. Here we report an experimental realization of a Carnot engine with a single optically trapped Brownian particle as the working substance. We present an exhaustive study of the energetics of the engine and analyse the fluctuations of the finite-time efficiency, showing that the Carnot bound can be surpassed for a small number of non-equilibrium cycles. As its macroscopic counterpart, the energetics of our Carnot device exhibits basic properties that one would expect to observe in any microscopic energy transducer operating with baths at different temperatures9,10,11. Our results characterize the sources of irreversibility in the engine and the statistical properties of the efficiency—an insight that could inspire new strategies in the design of efficient nano-motors.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27009994@NATURE_PHYSICS

In this vein, finding ways to confine and direct electronic waves through nanoscale streams and streamlets, unimpeded by the presence of other carriers, has remained a grand challenge9,10,11,12. Inspired by guiding of light in fibre optics, here we demonstrate a route to engineer such a flow of electrons using a technique for mapping currents at submicron scales. We employ real-space imaging of current flow in graphene to provide direct evidence of the confinement of electron waves at the edges of a graphene crystal near charge neutrality. This is achieved by using superconducting interferometry in a graphene Josephson junction and reconstructing the spatial structure of conducting pathways using Fourier methods13. The observed edge currents arise from coherent guided-wave states, confined to the edge by band bending and transmitted as plane waves. As an electronic analogue of photon guiding in optical fibres, the observed states afford non-classical means for information transduction and processing at the nanoscale.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27051395@NATURE_PHYSICS

In the strong magnetic field, solar axions can be converted to X-ray photons which can be recorded by X-ray detectors. In the 2013–2015 run, thanks to low-background detectors and a new X-ray telescope, the signal-to-noise ratio was increased by about a factor of three.

The technological challenges of fusion energy are intimately linked with the availability of suitable materials capable of reliably withstanding the extremely severe operational conditions of fusion reactors. Although fission and fusion materials exhibit common features, fusion materials research is broader. The harder mono-energetic spectrum associated with the deuterium–tritium fusion neutrons (14.1 MeV compared to <2 MeV on average for fission neutrons) releases significant amounts of hydrogen and helium as transmutation products that might lead to a (at present undetermined) degradation of structural materials after a few years of operation. Overcoming the historical lack of a fusion-relevant neutron source for materials testing is an essential pending step in fusion roadmaps.

Until recently, it was thought that superconductivity emerges only from an orthorhombic antiferromagnetic stripe phase, which can in principle be described in terms of either localized or itinerant spins. However, we recently reported that tetragonal symmetry is restored inside the magnetically ordered state of certain hole-doped compounds, revealing the existence of a new magnetic phase at compositions close to the onset of superconductivity. Here, we present Mössbauer data that show that half of the iron sites in this tetragonal phase are non-magnetic, establishing conclusively the existence of a novel magnetic ground state with a non-uniform magnetization that is inconsistent with localized spins. Instead, this state is naturally explained as the interference between two commensurate spin-density waves, a rare example of collinear double-Q magnetic order.

The large energy scale of magnetic excitations, for example, compared with phonon energies, is thought to drive superconductivity with high transition temperatures (Tc). Comparing high-energy magnetic excitations of hole- and electron-doped superconductors provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering at the Cu L3-edge to reveal collective excitations in the electron-doped cuprate Nd2−xCexCuO4. Surprisingly, magnetic excitations harden significantly across the antiferromagnetic high-temperature superconductivity phase boundary despite short-ranged antiferromagnetic correlations, in contrast to the hole-doped cuprates. Furthermore, we find an unexpected branch of collective modes in superconducting compounds, absent in hole-doped cuprates. These modes emanate from the zone centre and possess a higher temperature scale than Tc, signalling a distinct quantum phase. Despite their differences, the persistence of magnetic excitations and the existence of a distinct quantum phase are apparently universal in both hole- and electron-doped cuprates.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24726027@NATURE_PHYSICS

Many interesting new phenomena occur, however, in hybrid superconducting/ferromagnetic systems. For example, a Josephson junction containing a ferromagnetic material can exhibit an intrinsic phase shift of π in its ground state for certain thicknesses of the material1. Such ‘π-junctions’ were first realized experimentally in 2001 (refs 2,3), and have been proposed as circuit elements for both high-speed classical superconducting computing and for quantum computing4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the phase state of a Josephson junction containing two ferromagnetic layers can be toggled between 0 and π by changing the relative orientation of the two magnetizations. These controllable 0–π junctions have immediate applications in cryogenic memory, where they serve as a necessary component to an ultralow power superconducting computer11. Such a fully superconducting computer is estimated to be orders of magnitude more energy-efficient than current semiconductor-based supercomputers12. Phase-controllable junctions also open up new possibilities for superconducting circuit elements such as superconducting ‘programmable logic’, where they could function in superconducting analogues to field-programmable gate arrays.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27082199@NATURE_PHYSICS

Quasiparticle dynamics have been studied in detail in metallic superconductors10,11,12,13,14 but remain relatively unexplored in semiconductor–superconductor structures, which are now being intensely pursued in the context of topological superconductivity. To this end, we use a system comprising a gate-confined semiconductor nanowire with an epitaxially grown superconductor layer, yielding an isolated, proximitized nanowire segment. We identify bound states in the semiconductor by means of bias spectroscopy, determine the characteristic temperatures and magnetic fields for quasiparticle excitations, and extract a parity lifetime (poisoning time) of the bound state in the semiconductor exceeding 10 ms.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31848351@NATURE_PHYSICS

Such spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) hold great promise as extremely compact and broadband microwave signal generators and magnonic spin wave injectors. Here we show that SHNOs can also be mutually synchronized with unprecedented efficiency. We demonstrate mutual synchronization of up to nine individual SHNOs, each separated by 300 nm. Through further tailoring of the connection regions we can extend the synchronization range to 4 μm. The mutual synchronization is observed electrically as an increase in the power and coherence of the microwave signal, and confirmed optically using micro-Brillouin light scattering microscopy as two spin wave regions sharing the same spectral content, in agreement with our micromagnetic simulations.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29560284@NATURE_PHYSICS

For the development of TI-based spin current devices, it is essential to evaluate this conversion efficiency quantitatively as a function of the Fermi level position EF. Here we introduce a coefficient qICS to characterize the interface C–S conversion effect by means of the spin torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) for (Bi1−xSbx)2Te3 thin films as EF is tuned across the bandgap. In bulk insulating conditions, the interface C–S conversion effect via the Dirac surface state is evaluated as having large, nearly constant values of qICS, reflecting that qICS is inversely proportional to the Fermi velocity vF, which is almost constant. However, when EF traverses through the Dirac point, the qICS is remarkably reduced, possibly due to inhomogeneity of kF and/or instability of the helical spin structure. These results demonstrate that fine tuning of EF in TI-based heterostructures is critical in maximizing the efficiency using the spin–momentum locking mechanism.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=28265595@NATURE_PHYSICS

In 1948, Förster established the theory of fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET) between broadband, nearly-resonant donors and acceptors2. The 1/R6 scaling of the energy transfer rate, where R is the distance between particles, enabled widespread use of FRET as a ‘spectroscopic ruler’ for determining nanometric distances in biomolecules3. The underlying mechanism is a coherent dipolar coupling between particles, as recognized in the early days of quantum mechanics4, but this coherence has not been directly observed so far. Here we study, spectroscopically and in the time domain, the coherent, dipolar-induced exchange of excitations between two Rydberg atoms separated by up to 15 μm, and brought into resonance by applying an electric field. Coherent oscillation of the system between two degenerate pair states then occurs at a frequency scaling as 1/R3, the hallmark of resonant dipole–dipole interactions5.

Although the overwhelming majority of FQH states have odd-denominator fillings, the physical properties of the rare and fragile even-denominator states are most tantalizing in view of their potential relevance for topological quantum computation. For decades, GaAs has been the preferred host for studying these even-denominator states, where they occur at νe = 5/2 and 7/2. Here we report an anomalous series of quantized even-denominator FQH states outside the realm of III–V semiconductors in the MgZnO/ZnO 2DES electron at νe = 3/2 and 7/2, with precursor features at 9/2; all while the 5/2 state is absent. The effect in this material occurs concomitantly with tunability of the orbital character of electrons at the chemical potential, thereby realizing a new experimental means for investigating these exotic ground states.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24600152@NATURE_PHYSICS

In particular, spin-transfer torque (STT) driven by thermal transport provides a new way to manipulate local magnetization. We quantify thermal STT in metallic spin-valve structures using an intense and ultrafast heat current created by picosecond pulses of laser light. Our result shows that thermal STT consists of demagnetization-driven and spin-dependent Seebeck effect (SDSE)-driven components; the SDSE-driven STT becomes dominant after 3 ps.

Whereas theoretical methods of direct applicability to real isolated networks exist, the frameworks developed so far in percolation theory for interdependent network layers are of little help in practical contexts, as they are suited only for special models in the limit of infinite size. Here, we introduce a set of heuristic equations that takes as inputs the adjacency matrices of the layers to draw the entire phase diagram for the interconnected network. We demonstrate that percolation transitions in interdependent networks can be understood by decomposing these systems into uncoupled graphs: the intersection among the layers, and the remainders of the layers. When the intersection dominates the remainders, an interconnected network undergoes a smooth percolation transition. Conversely, if the intersection is dominated by the contribution of the remainders, the transition becomes abrupt even in small networks. We provide examples of real systems that have developed interdependent networks sharing cores of ‘high quality’ edges to prevent catastrophic failures.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24551823@NATURE_PHYSICS

Gamma-ray (γ-ray) blazars have been predicted to yield a cumulative neutrino signal exceeding the atmospheric background above energies of 100 TeV, assuming that both the neutrinos and the γ-ray photons are produced by accelerated protons in relativistic jets. As the background spectrum falls steeply with increasing energy, the individual events with the clearest signature of being of extraterrestrial origin are those at petaelectronvolt energies. Inside the large positional-uncertainty fields of the first two petaelectronvolt neutrinos detected by IceCube, the integrated emission of the blazar population has a sufficiently high electromagnetic flux to explain the detected IceCube events, but fluences of individual objects are too low to make an unambiguous source association. Here, we report that a major outburst of the blazar PKS B1424–418 occurred in temporal and positional coincidence with a third petaelectronvolt-energy neutrino event (HESE-35) detected by IceCube. On the basis of an analysis of the full sample of γ-ray blazars in the HESE-35 field, we show that the long-term average γ-ray emission of blazars as a class is in agreement with both the measured all-sky flux of petaelectronvolt neutrinos and the spectral slope of the IceCube signal.

We perform direct spectroscopy of the phonon-dressed states emerging from this drive and observe hallmarks of the sought-after strong-driving regime6,11, where the spin rotation frequency exceeds the spin splitting. Furthermore, we employ our continuous strain driving to significantly enhance the NV’s spin coherence time12.

In most materials, the QCP is accessed by chemical substitution or applied pressure. CeCoIn5 is one of the few materials that are ‘born’ as a quantum critical superconductor2,3,4 and, therefore, offers the opportunity to explore the consequences of chemical disorder. Cadmium-doped crystals of CeCoIn5 are a particularly interesting case where Cd substitution induces long-range magnetic order5, as in Zn-doped copper oxides6,7. Applied pressure globally suppresses the Cd-induced magnetic order and restores bulk superconductivity. Here we show, however, that local magnetic correlations, whose spatial extent decreases with applied pressure, persist at the extrapolated QCP. The residual droplets of impurity-induced magnetic moments prevent the reappearance of conventional signatures of quantum criticality, but induce a heterogeneous electronic state. These discoveries show that spin droplets can be a source of electronic heterogeneity and emphasize the need for caution when interpreting the effects of tuning a correlated system by chemical substitution.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=21863903@NATURE_PHYSICS

Owing to its surface-exposed 2D electron gas and its gate-tunable charge carrier density, graphene coupled to superconductors is the ideal platform to study such phase transitions between ground states. Here, we show that decorating graphene with a sparse and regular array of superconducting discs enables the continuous gate-tuning of the quantum superconductor-to-metal transition of the Josephson junction array into a zero-temperature metallic state. The suppression of proximity-induced superconductivity is a direct consequence of the emergence of quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phase of the discs. Under perpendicular magnetic fields, the competition between quantum fluctuations and disorder is responsible for the resilience of superconductivity at the lowest temperatures, supporting a glassy state that persists above the upper critical field.

Stimulated Brillouin scattering of light from propagating hypersonic acoustic waves has also been used successfully for the generation of slow and fast light. However, Electromagnetically induced transparency-type processes based on stimulated Brillouin scattering were considered infeasible because of the short coherence lifetime of hypersonic phonons. Here, we report a new Brillouin scattering induced transparency phenomenon generated by acousto-optic interaction of light with long-lived propagating phonons in a silica resonator. We demonstrate that Brillouin scattering induced transparency is uniquely non-reciprocal owing to the propagating acoustic wave and accompanying momentum conservation requirement.

This is the scattering rate hypothesis, which has guided our understanding of metal conductivity for over a century. However, for so-called bad metals with very low σ this hypothesis predicts scattering rates so high as to conflict with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle1,2.

Here, we report a time-resolved experiment directly pumping discrete Landau levels in graphene. Energetically degenerate Landau-level transitions from n = −1 to n = 0 and from n = 0 to n = 1 are distinguished by applying circularly polarized THz light. An analysis based on a microscopic theory shows that the zeroth Landau level is actually depleted by strong Auger scattering, even though it is optically pumped at the same time. The surprisingly strong electron–electron interaction responsible for this effect is directly evidenced through a sign reversal of the pump–probe signal.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24452438@NATURE_PHYSICS

This makes them difficult to predict and hard to generate on demand. Here we demonstrate that we can trigger the onset of rare events akin to rogue waves controllably, and systematically use their generation to break the diffraction limit of light propagation. We illustrate this phenomenon in the case of a random field, where energy oscillates among incoherent degrees of freedom. Despite the low energy carried by each wave, we illustrate how to control a mechanism of spontaneous synchronization, which constructively builds up the spectral energy available in the whole bandwidth of the field into giant structures, whose statistics is predictable. The larger the frequency bandwidth of the random field, the larger the amplitude of rare events that are built up by this mechanism. Our system is composed of an integrated optical resonator, realized on a photonic crystal chip. Through near-field imaging experiments, we record confined rogue waves characterized by a spatial localization of 206 nm and with an ultrashort duration of 163 fs at a wavelength of 1.55 μm. Such localized energy patterns are formed in a deterministic dielectric structure that does not require nonlinear properties.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24668287@NATURE_PHYSICS

So far most efforts have focused on circumventing decoherence induced by the environment by either protecting the system from the associated noise1,2,3,4,5 or by manipulating the environment directly6,7,8,9. Recently, parallel efforts using the environment as a resource have emerged, which could enable dissipation-driven quantum computation and coupling of distant quantum bits10,11,12,13,14. Here, we realize the optical control of a semiconductor quantum-dot spin by relying on its interaction with an adiabatically evolving spin environment. The emergence of hyperfine-induced, quasi-static optical selection rules enables the optical generation of coherent spin dark states without an external magnetic field. We show that the phase and amplitude of the lasers implement multi-axis manipulation of the basis spanned by the dark and bright states, enabling control via projection into a spin-superposition state.

Such transitions are commonly believed to be continuous, but empirical studies have shown more violent spreading modes when the participating agents are not limited to one type. Striking examples include the co-epidemic of the Spanish flu and pneumonia that occurred in 1918 (refs 3, 4), and, more recently, the concurrent prevalence of HIV/AIDS and a host of diseases5,6,7. It remains unclear to what extent an outbreak in the presence of interacting pathogens differs from that due to an ordinary single-agent process. Here we study a mechanistic model for understanding contagion processes involving inter-agent cooperation. Our stochastic simulations reveal the possible emergence of a massive avalanche-like outbreak right at the threshold, which is manifested as a discontinuous phase transition. Such an abrupt change arises only if the underlying network topology supports a bottleneck for cascaded mutual infections. Surprisingly, all these discontinuous transitions are accompanied by non-trivial critical behaviours, presenting a rare case of hybrid transition8. The findings may imply the origin of catastrophic occurrences in many realistic systems, from co-epidemics to financial contagions9.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=25187997@NATURE_PHYSICS

The resemblance of its crystallographic, magnetic and electronic structures1,2,3,4,5,6 to La2CuO4, as well as the emergence on doping of a pseudogap region7,8,9 and a low-temperature d-wave gap10,11, has particularly strengthened analogies to cuprate high-Tc superconductors12. However, unlike the cuprate phase diagram, which features a plethora of broken symmetry phases13 in a pseudogap region that includes charge density wave, stripe, nematic and possibly intra-unit-cell loop-current orders, no broken symmetry phases proximate to the parent antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase in Sr2IrO4 have been observed so far, making the comparison of iridate to cuprate phenomenology incomplete. Using optical second-harmonic generation, we report evidence of a hidden non-dipolar magnetic order in Sr2IrO4 that breaks both the spatial inversion and rotational symmetries of the underlying tetragonal lattice. Four distinct domain types corresponding to discrete 90°-rotated orientations of a pseudovector order parameter are identified using nonlinear optical microscopy, which is expected from an electronic phase that possesses the symmetries of a magneto-electric loop-current order14,15,16,17,18. The onset temperature of this phase is monotonically suppressed with bulk hole doping, albeit much more weakly than the Néel temperature, revealing an extended region of the phase diagram with purely hidden order.

Even after half a century, however, the emergence of the ferroelectric state has remained the subject of fierce debate. We resolve the interplay of electric polarization, topological trimerization and temperature by direct access to the polarization for temperatures up to 1,400 K. Nonlinear optical experiments and piezoresponse force microscopy, complemented by Monte Carlo simulations, reveal a single phase transition with ferroelectricity determined by topology rather than electrostatics.

Despite considerable progress in uncovering the qubit dynamics in strong magnetic fields1,2,3,4, decoherence at very low magnetic fields remains puzzling, and the role of quadrupole coupling of nuclear spins is poorly understood. For spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots, phenomenological models of decoherence include two basic types of spin relaxation5,6,7: fast dephasing due to static but randomly distributed hyperfine fields (∼2 ns)8,9,10,11 and a much slower process (>1 μs) of irreversible monotonic relaxation due either to nuclear spin co-flips or other complex many-body interaction effects12. Here we show that this is an oversimplification; the spin qubit relaxation is determined by three rather than two distinct stages. The additional stage corresponds to the effect of coherent precession processes that occur in the nuclear spin bath itself, leading to a relatively fast but incomplete non-monotonic relaxation at intermediate timescales (∼750 ns).@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26869995@NATURE_PHYSICS

However, our understanding of even deceptively simple systems of interacting spin-1/2 particles is far from complete. The quantum square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, for example, exhibits a striking anomaly of hitherto unknown origin in its magnetic excitation spectrum. This quantum effect manifests itself for excitations propagating with the specific wavevector (π, 0). We use polarized neutron spectroscopy to fully characterize the magnetic fluctuations in the metal-organic compound Cu(DCOO)2⋅4D2O, a known realization of the quantum square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet model. Our experiments reveal an isotropic excitation continuum at the anomaly, which we analyse theoretically using Gutzwiller-projected trial wavefunctions. The excitation continuum is accounted for by the existence of spatially extended pairs of fractional S = 1/2 quasiparticles, 2D analogues of 1D spinons. Away from the anomalous wavevector, these fractional excitations are bound and form conventional magnons.

Recently, solitons have been realized in microcavities7, thereby bringing the power of microfabrication methods to future applications. This work reports a soliton not previously observed in optical systems, the Stokes soliton. The Stokes soliton forms and regenerates by optimizing its Raman interaction in space and time within an optical potential well shared with another soliton. The Stokes and the initial soliton belong to distinct transverse mode families and benefit from a form of soliton trapping that is new to microcavities and soliton lasers in general.

This effect lies beyond linear response, is absent in undisordered insulators and highlights the remarkable subtlety of localized phases. The effect is common to both single-particle and many-body localized phases. Our results have implications for numerous fields, including topological quantum computation in quantum Hall systems, quantum control in disordered environments, and time-dependent localized systems. For example, they indicate that attempts to braid quasiparticles in quantum Hall systems or Majorana nanowires will not succeed if the manipulations are performed asymptotically slowly, and thus using such platforms for topological quantum computation will require considerable engineering.

The charge current in ferromagnetic transition metals is carried by two non-mixing populations of sp-band Fermi-level electrons: one of majority-spin and one of minority-spin. These electrons experience spin-dependent momentum scattering with localized electrons, which originate from the spin-split d-band. The direct observation of magnetotransport under such fundamental conditions, however, requires magnetotransport measurements on the same timescale as the electron momentum scattering, which takes place in the sub-100 fs regime. Using terahertz electromagnetic probes, we directly observe the magnetotransport in a metallic system under the fundamental conditions, and determine the spin-dependent densities and momentum scattering times of conduction electrons. We show that traditional measurements significantly underestimate the spin asymmetry in electron scattering, a key parameter responsible for effects such as GMR. Furthermore, we demonstrate the possibility of magnetic modulation of terahertz waves, along with heat- and contact-free GMR readout using ultrafast terahertz signals.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=25197430@NATURE_PHYSICS

The edge conduction is strongly suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field and is independent of gate voltage, save for mesoscopic fluctuations that grow on cooling due to a zero-bias anomaly, which reduces the linear-response conductance. Bilayer WTe2 also becomes insulating at low temperatures but does not show edge conduction. Many of these observations are consistent with monolayer WTe2 being a 2DTI.

Here we consider low-energy quantum mechanics in the presence of gravitational time dilation and show that the latter leads to the decoherence of quantum superpositions. Time dilation induces a universal coupling between the internal degrees of freedom and the centre of mass of a composite particle. The resulting correlations lead to decoherence in the particle position, even without any external environment. We also show that the weak time dilation on Earth is already sufficient to affect micrometre-scale objects.

Here we report the discovery of the supernova iPTF 13dqy  = SN 2013fs  a mere ∼3 h after explosion. Our rapid follow-up observations, which include multiwavelength photometry and extremely early (beginning at ∼6 h post-explosion) spectra, map the distribution of material in the immediate environment (≲1015 cm) of the exploding star and establish that it was surrounded by circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected during the final ∼1 yr prior to explosion at a high rate, around 10−3 solar masses per year. The complete disappearance of flash-ionized emission lines within the first several days requires that the dense CSM be confined to within ≲1015 cm, consistent with radio non-detections at 70–100 days. The observations indicate that iPTF 13dqy was a regular type II supernova; thus, the finding that the probable red supergiant progenitor of this common explosion ejected material at a highly elevated rate just prior to its demise suggests that pre-supernova instabilities may be common among exploding massive stars.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31876743@NATURE_PHYSICS

This phenomenon, akin to superconductivity in metals, has until now been observed only at prohibitively low cryogenic temperatures. For atoms, this limit is imposed by the small thermal de Broglie wavelength, which is inversely related to the particle mass. Even in the case of ultralight quasiparticles such as exciton-polaritons, superfluidity has been demonstrated only at liquid helium temperatures2. In this case, the limit is not imposed by the mass, but instead by the small binding energy of Wannier–Mott excitons, which sets the upper temperature limit. Here we demonstrate a transition from supersonic to superfluid flow in a polariton condensate under ambient conditions. This is achieved by using an organic microcavity supporting stable Frenkel exciton-polaritons at room temperature.

Despite strong interest, experiments on the subject proved challenging because of the simultaneous presence of different scattering mechanisms that suppress or obscure consequences of e-e scattering. Only recently, sufficiently clean electron systems with transport dominated by e-e collisions have become available, showing behaviour characteristic of highly viscous fluids. Here we study electron transport through graphene constrictions and show that their conductance below 150 K increases with increasing temperature, in stark contrast to the metallic character of doped graphene. Notably, the measured conductance exceeds the maximum conductance possible for free electrons. This anomalous behaviour is attributed to collective movement of interacting electrons, which € shields' individual carriers from momentum loss at sample boundaries. The measurements allow us to identify the conductance contribution arising due to electron viscosity and determine its temperature dependence. Besides fundamental interest, our work shows that viscous effects can facilitate high-mobility transport at elevated temperatures, a potentially useful behaviour for designing graphene-based devices.

We show that the SDW domains can be switched completely by a tiny change of the magnetic field direction, which is naturally explained by the presence of triplet superconductivity. Further, the Q-phase emerges in a common magneto-superconducting quantum critical point. The Q-phase of CeCoIn5 thus represents an example where spatially modulated superconductivity is associated with SDW order."@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=28704506@NATURE_PHYSICS

On the basis of this logic, spin fluctuations have been considered as the origin of pairing of the superconducting electrons in the cuprates1. As possible pairing mechanisms, there is growing interest in unconventional spin fluctuations or advanced orbital fluctuations owing to the characteristic multi-orbital states in iron pnictides3,4,5,6. Here, we report the discovery of an antiferromagnetic phase as well as a unique structural transition in electron-overdoped LaFeAsO1−xHx (x  0.5), whereby a second parent phase is uncovered, albeit heavily doped. The unprecedented two-dome superconducting phases observed in this material can be interpreted as a consequence of the carrier doping starting from the original x  0 and additional x  0.5 parent phases towards the intermediate region7. The bipartite parent phases with distinct physical properties in the second magnetic phase provide us with an interesting example to illustrate the intimate interplay between the magnetic interaction, structural change and orbital degree of freedom in iron pnictide superconductors.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=22130384@NATURE_PHYSICS

Interactions this strong, beyond opening up a new regime in optics4, could lead to technologies such as all-optical quantum information processing5,6. However, the extreme weakness of photon–photon scattering has hindered any attempt to observe such interactions at the level of single particles. Here we present an implementation of a strong optical nonlinearity using electromagnetically induced transparency7, and a direct measurement of the resulting nonlinear phase shift for single post-selected photons. We show that the observed phase shift depends not only on the incident intensity of the (coherent-state) input signal, but also in a discrete fashion on whether 0 or 1 photons are detected at the output. We believe that this constitutes the first direct measurement of the cross-phase shift due to single photons, whose presence or absence is established based on a discrete detection event. It opens a door to future studies of nonlinear optics in the quantum regime, and potential applications in areas such as quantum information processing.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31815260@NATURE_PHYSICS

The unique pseudospin structure of Dirac electrons leads to emerging phenomena such as the massless Dirac cone2, anomalous quantum Hall effect2,3, and Klein tunnelling4,5 in graphene. The capability to manipulate electron pseudospin is highly desirable for novel graphene electronics, and it requires precise control to differentiate the two graphene sublattices at the atomic level. Graphene/boron nitride moiré superlattices, where a fast sublattice oscillation due to boron and nitrogen atoms is superimposed on the slow moiré period, provides an attractive approach to engineer the electron pseudospin in graphene13,14,15,16,17,18. This unusual moiré superlattice leads to a spinor potential with unusual hybridization of electron pseudospins, which can be probed directly through infrared spectroscopy because optical transitions are very sensitive to excited state wavefunctions. Here, we perform micro-infrared spectroscopy on a graphene/boron nitride heterostructure and demonstrate that the moiré superlattice potential is dominated by a pseudospin-mixing component analogous to a spatially varying pseudomagnetic field. In addition, we show that the spinor potential depends sensitively on the gate-induced carrier concentration in graphene, indicating a strong renormalization of the spinor potential from electron–electron interactions.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=28203010@NATURE_PHYSICS

Even more surprising is the fragmentation of the degrees of freedom themselves, leading to coexisting and a priori independent ground states. This puzzling phenomenon was recently put forward in the context of spin ice, in which the magnetic moment field can fragment, resulting in a dual ground state consisting of a fluctuating spin liquid, a so-called Coulomb phase5, on top of a magnetic monopole crystal6. Here we show, by means of neutron scattering measurements, that such fragmentation occurs in the spin ice candidate Nd2Zr2O7. We observe the spectacular coexistence of an antiferromagnetic order induced by the monopole crystallization and a fluctuating state with ferromagnetic correlations. Experimentally, this fragmentation manifests itself through the superposition of magnetic Bragg peaks, characteristic of the ordered phase, and a pinch point pattern, characteristic of the Coulomb phase. These results highlight the relevance of the fragmentation concept to describe the physics of systems that are simultaneously ordered and fluctuating.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27129767@NATURE_PHYSICS

Theory has predicted the existence of disorder-induced phenomena, such as Anderson localization1 or the emergence of a Bose glass2. More recently, it has been shown that when disorder breaks 2D continuous symmetry, long-range correlations can be enhanced3. Experimentally, developments in quantum gases have allowed the observation of the effects of competition between interaction and disorder4,5. However, experiments exploring the effect of symmetry-breaking disorder are lacking. Here, we create a 2D vortex lattice at 0.1 K in a superconducting thin film with a well-defined 1D thickness modulation—the symmetry-breaking disorder—and track the field-induced modification using scanning tunnelling microscopy. We find that the 1D modulation becomes incommensurate with the vortex lattice and drives an order–disorder transition, behaving as a scale-invariant disorder potential. We show that the transition occurs in two steps and is mediated by the proliferation of topological defects. The resulting critical exponents determining the loss of positional and orientational order are far above theoretical expectations for scale-invariant disorder6,7,8 and follow instead the critical behaviour describing dislocation unbinding melting9,10.

An applied magnetic field quantizes graphene’s gapless conduction and valence band states into discrete Landau levels, allowing us to resolve individual inter-Landau-level transitions and thereby demonstrate that the energy, momentum and chiral properties of the electrons are conserved in the tunnelling process.

The Mott metal–insulator transition3, a phenomenon that is central to many investigations of strongly correlated electrons, is also supposed to be quantum critical, although this has so far not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we report experimental evidence for the quantum-critical nature of the Mott instability, obtained by investigating the electron transport of three organic systems with different ground states under continuously controlled pressure. The resistivity obeys the material-independent quantum-critical scaling relation bifurcating into a Fermi liquid or Mott insulator, irrespective of the ground states. Electrons on the verge of becoming delocalized behave like a strange quantum-critical fluid before becoming a Fermi liquid.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31827786@NATURE_PHYSICS

The observation of QSL states is a central aim of experimental physics, because they host collective excitations that transcend our knowledge of quantum matter; however, examples in real materials are scarce2. Here, we report neutron-scattering experiments on YbMgGaO4, a QSL candidate in which Yb3+ ions with effective spin-1/2 occupy a triangular lattice3,4,5,6. Our measurements reveal a continuum of magnetic excitations—the essential experimental hallmark of a QSL7—at very low temperature (0.06 K). The origin of this peculiar excitation spectrum is a crucial question, because isotropic nearest-neighbour interactions do not yield a QSL ground state on the triangular lattice8. Using measurements in the field-polarized state, we identify antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbour interactions9,10,11,12, spin-space anisotropies4,10,13,14, and chemical disorder15 between the magnetic layers as key ingredients in YbMgGaO4.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29561720@NATURE_PHYSICS

An impurity can break the electron pairs into quasiparticles with energy states inside the superconducting gap. The characteristics of such in-gap states reflect accordingly the properties of the superconducting ground state1. A zero-energy in-gap state is particularly noteworthy, because it can be the consequence of non-trivial pairing symmetry1 or topology2,3. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy to demonstrate that an isotropic zero-energy bound state with a decay length of ∼10 Å emerges at each interstitial iron impurity in superconducting Fe(Te,Se). More noticeably, this zero-energy bound state is robust against a magnetic field up to 8 T, as well as perturbations by neighbouring impurities. Such a spectroscopic feature has no natural explanation in terms of impurity states in superconductors with s-wave symmetry, but bears all the characteristics of the Majorana bound state proposed for topological superconductors2,3, indicating that the superconducting state and the scattering mechanism of the interstitial iron impurities in Fe(Te,Se) are highly unconventional.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24584450@NATURE_PHYSICS

The addition energy of an odd, unpaired quasiparticle equals the superconducting gap, Δ, suppressing single-electron hopping in the low-temperature limit, kBT ≪ Δ. Controlling the quasiparticle occupation is of fundamental importance for superconducting qubits as single-electron tunnelling results in decoherence3,4. In particular, topological quantum computation relies on the parity control and readout of Majorana bound states5,6. Here we present the first parity modulation of a niobium titanite nitride (NbTiN) Cooper-pair transistor coupled to aluminium (Al) leads. We show that this circuit is compatible with the magnetic field requirement B ∼ 100 mT of inducing topological superconductivity in spin–orbit-coupled nanowires7,8,9. Our observed parity lifetime exceeding 1 min is several orders of magnitude higher than the required gate time for flux-controlled braiding of Majorana states10.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24596887@NATURE_PHYSICS

The transverse thermoelectric (Nernst) effect is particularly sensitive to the fluctuations, and the large Nernst signal found in the pseudogap regime of the underdoped cuprates2,3 has raised much debate. Here we report on the observation of a colossal Nernst signal due to the superconducting fluctuations in the heavy-fermion superconductor URu2Si2. The Nernst coefficient is anomalously enhanced (by a factor of ∼106) as compared with the theoretically expected value of the Gaussian fluctuations. Moreover, contrary to the conventional wisdom, the enhancement is more significant with a reduction of the impurity scattering rate. This unconventional Nernst effect intimately reflects the highly unusual superconducting state of URu2Si2. The results invoke possible chiral or Berry-phase fluctuations associated with the broken time-reversal symmetry4,5,6,7 of the superconducting order parameter.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24497515@NATURE_PHYSICS

However, the spontaneous formation of spatial patterns amidst insulator–metal phase coexistence remains poorly explored on the meso- and nanoscales. Here we present real-space evolution of the insulator–metal transition in a V2O3 thin film imaged at high spatial resolution by cryogenic near-field infrared microscopy. We resolve spontaneously nanotextured coexistence of metal and correlated Mott insulator phases near the insulator–metal transition (∼160–180 K) associated with percolation and an underlying structural phase transition. Augmented with macroscopic temperature-resolved X-ray diffraction measurements of the same film, a quantitative analysis of nano-infrared images acquired across the transition suggests decoupling of electronic and structural transformations. Persistent low-temperature metallicity is accompanied by unconventional critical behaviour, implicating the long-range Coulomb interaction as a driving force through the film’s first-order insulator–metal transition.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29512197@NATURE_PHYSICS

On the one hand, nanoscale arrangements of magnetic atoms are at the heart of future quantum computing and spintronic devices2,3; on the other hand, they can be used as fundamental building blocks for the realization of textbook many-body quantum models4, illustrating key concepts such as quantum phase transitions, topological order or frustration as a function of system size. Here, we use low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy to construct arrays of magnetic atoms on a surface, designed to behave like spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chains in a transverse field, for which a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase is predicted in the thermodynamic limit5. Site-resolved measurements on these finite-size realizations reveal a number of sudden ground state changes when the field approaches the critical value, each corresponding to a new domain wall entering the chains. We observe that these state crossings become closer for longer chains, suggesting the onset of critical behaviour. Our results present opportunities for further studies on quantum behaviour of many-body systems, as a function of their size and structural complexity.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26971197@NATURE_PHYSICS

Although a number of such systems exist1,2,3,4,5,6, it would be desirable to be able to test theoretical proposals in an artificial system that allows precise control over the key parameters of the model7. The essential physics of several topological systems can be captured by tight-binding models, which can also be implemented in artificial lattices6,7. Here, we show that this method can be realized in a vacancy lattice in a chlorine monolayer on a Cu(100) surface. We use low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) to fabricate such lattices with atomic precision and probe the resulting local density of states (LDOS) with scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS). We create analogues of two tight-binding models of fundamental importance: the polyacetylene (dimer) chain with topological domain-wall states, and the Lieb lattice with a flat electron band. These results provide an important step forward in the ongoing effort to realize designer quantum materials with tailored properties.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31994164@NATURE_PHYSICS

But recent studies have suggested the involvement of non-equilibrium processes, without definitively ruling out equilibrium interpretations. Using active and passive microrheology to directly compare the membrane response and fluctuations on single erythrocytes, we report here a violation of the fluctuation–dissipation relation, which is a direct demonstration of the non-equilibrium nature of flickering. With an analytical model of the composite erythrocyte membrane and realistic stochastic simulations, we show that several molecular mechanisms may explain the active fluctuations, and we predict their kinetics. We demonstrate that tangential metabolic activity in the network formed by spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein, can generate curvature-mediated active membrane motions. We also show that other active membrane processes represented by direct normal force dipoles may explain the observed membrane activity. Our findings provide solid experimental and theoretical frameworks for future investigations of the origin and function of active motion in cells.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26841336@NATURE_PHYSICS

Some specific geometries give rise to novel and potentially useful electronic bands. For example, a honeycomb lattice leads to Dirac-type bands where the charge carriers behave as massless particles1. Theoretical predictions are triggering the exploration of novel two-dimensional (2D) geometries2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, such as graphynes and the kagomé and Lieb lattices. The Lieb lattice is the 2D analogue of the 3D lattice exhibited by perovskites2; it is a square-depleted lattice, which is characterized by a band structure featuring Dirac cones intersected by a flat band. Whereas photonic and cold-atom Lieb lattices have been demonstrated11,12,13,14,15,16,17, an electronic equivalent in 2D is difficult to realize in an existing material. Here, we report an electronic Lieb lattice formed by the surface state electrons of Cu(111) confined by an array of carbon monoxide molecules positioned with a scanning tunnelling microscope. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, spectroscopy and wavefunction mapping, we confirm the predicted characteristic electronic structure of the Lieb lattice. The experimental findings are corroborated by muffin-tin and tight-binding calculations. At higher energies, second-order electronic patterns are observed, which are equivalent to a super-Lieb lattice.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=32027003@NATURE_PHYSICS

Here we study where these regions are found in full three-dimensional simulations. In two dimensions the sites of electron diffusion, defined as the regions where magnetic topology changes and electrons move with respect to the magnetic field lines, are located near the reconnection site. But in three dimensions we find that the reconnection exhaust far from the primary reconnection site also becomes host to secondary reconnection sites. Four diagnostics are used to demonstrate the point: the direct observation of topology impossible without secondary reconnection, the direct measurement of topological field line breakage, the measurement of electron jets emerging from secondary reconnection regions, and the violation of the frozen-in condition. We conclude that secondary reconnection occurs in a large part of the exhaust, providing many more chances for MMS to find itself in the right region to hit its target.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24705504@NATURE_PHYSICS

Such differences are associated with the non-invariance of fundamental interactions under the combined charge-conjugation and parity transformations, known as CP violation. Here, using data from the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, we search for CP-violating asymmetries in the decay angle distributions of Λb0 baryons decaying to pπ−π+π− and pπ−K+K− final states. These four-body hadronic decays are a promising place to search for sources of CP violation both within and beyond the standard model of particle physics. We find evidence for CP violation in Λb0 to pπ−π+π− decays with a statistical significance corresponding to 3.3 standard deviations including systematic uncertainties. This represents the first evidence for CP violation in the baryon sector.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29476606@NATURE_PHYSICS

Hence, the ability to observe the two-component wavefunction is useful for exploring novel spin phenomena. Here we show that the two-component nature is manifest in Landau levels, the degeneracy of which is lifted by a Coulomb potential. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelling microscopy, we visualize energy and spatial structures of Landau levels in Bi2Se3, a prototypical topological insulator. The observed Landau-level splitting and internal structures of Landau orbits are distinct from those in a conventional electron system7 and are well reproduced by a two-component model Dirac Hamiltonian.

Engineering vacuum fluctuations is therefore becoming increasingly important to emerging technologies. Here, we shape vacuum fluctuations using a superconducting circuit analogue of a mirror, creating regions in space where they are suppressed. Moving an artificial atom through these regions and measuring the spontaneous emission lifetime of the atom provides us with the spectral density of the vacuum fluctuations. Using the paradigm of waveguide quantum electrodynamics, we significantly improve over previous studies of the interaction of an atom with its mirror image, observing a spectral density as low as 0.02 quanta, a factor of 50 below the mirrorless result.

Among the various schemes proposed for electrons, vacuum laser acceleration has attracted considerable interest and has been extensively studied theoretically because of its appealing simplicity: electrons interact with an intense laser field in vacuum and can be continuously accelerated, provided they remain at a given phase of the field until they escape the laser beam. But demonstrating this effect experimentally has proved extremely challenging, as it imposes stringent requirements on the conditions of injection of electrons in the laser field. Here, we solve this long-standing experimental problem by using a plasma mirror to inject electrons in an ultraintense laser field, and obtain clear evidence of vacuum laser acceleration. With the advent of petawatt lasers, this scheme could provide a competitive source of very high charge (nC) and ultrashort relativistic electron beams.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26963696@NATURE_PHYSICS

Among the candidates are antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations1,4,5 and d-orbital fluctuations amplified by phonons6,7. Any such electron–boson interaction should alter the electron’s ‘self-energy’, and then become detectable through consequent modifications in the energy dependence of the electron’s momentum and lifetime8,9,10. Here we introduce a novel theoretical/experimental approach aimed at uniquely identifying the relevant fluctuations of iron-based superconductors by measuring effects of their self-energy. We use innovative quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging11 techniques in LiFeAs to reveal strongly momentum-space anisotropic self-energy signatures that are focused along the Fe–Fe (interband scattering) direction, where the spin fluctuations of LiFeAs are concentrated. These effects coincide in energy with perturbations to the density of states N(ω) usually associated with the Cooper pairing interaction. We show that all the measured phenomena comprise the predicted QPI ‘fingerprint’ of a self-energy due to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, thereby distinguishing them as the predominant electron–boson interaction.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24576664@NATURE_PHYSICS

Especially challenging is understanding the recently discovered ultra-relativistic third electron radiation belt. Current theory asserts that loss in the heart of the outer belt, essential to the formation of the third belt, must be controlled by high-frequency plasma wave–particle scattering into the atmosphere, via whistler mode chorus, plasmaspheric hiss, or electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. However, this has failed to accurately reproduce the third belt. Using a data-driven, time-dependent specification of ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves we show for the first time how the third radiation belt is established as a simple, elegant consequence of storm-time extremely fast outward ULF wave transport. High-frequency wave–particle scattering loss into the atmosphere is not needed in this case. When rapid ULF wave transport coupled to a dynamic boundary is accurately specified, the sensitive dynamics controlling the enigmatic ultra-relativistic third radiation belt are naturally explained.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=28207763@NATURE_PHYSICS

The importance of this state is that it is coherent and highly entangled without breaking local symmetries. In the case of magnets with isotropic interactions, spin-liquid behaviour is sought in simple lattices with antiferromagnetic interactions that favour antiparallel alignments of the magnetic moments and are incompatible with the lattice geometries. Despite an extensive search, experimental realizations remain very few. Here we investigate the novel, unexplored magnet Ca10Cr7O28, which has a complex Hamiltonian consisting of several different isotropic interactions and where the ferromagnetic couplings are stronger than the antiferromagnetic ones. We show both experimentally and theoretically that it displays all the features expected of a quantum spin liquid.

In conventional topological insulators in three dimensions, the low-energy theory near the gap-closing point can be described by relativistic Dirac fermions coupled to the long-range Coulomb interaction; hence, the quantum critical point of topological phase transitions provides a promising platform to test the intriguing predictions of quantum electrodynamics. Here we discover a class of quantum critical phenomena in topological materials for which either the inversion symmetry or time-reversal symmetry can be broken. At the quantum critical point, the emerging low-energy fermions, dubbed the anisotropic Weyl fermions, show both relativistic and Newtonian dynamics simultaneously.

Such a pre-thermalized state was observed in recent experiments in a one-dimensional Bose gas after it had been coherently split into two. Although the existence of local conserved quantities is usually considered to be the key ingredient of pre-thermalization, the question of whether non-local correlations between the subsystems can influence pre-thermalization of the entire system has remained unanswered. Here we study the dynamics of coherently split one-dimensional Bose gases and find that the initial entanglement combined with energy degeneracy due to parity and translation invariance strongly affects the long-term behaviour of the system. The mechanism of this entanglement pre-thermalization is quite general and not restricted to one-dimensional Bose gases.

By measuring excitations generated during the quench, we provide evidence for superfluid puddles in the Bose glass phase and produce a superfluid–Bose glass phase diagram consistent with completely constrained, finite temperature, and equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo simulations.

This scenario was also proposed as a primary mechanism for accelerating energetic particles during reconnection8, but experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here, we identify a total of 19 flux ropes during reconnection in the magnetotail.

The resulting non-deterministic motion of photons on the Planck scale is expected to produce energy-dependent stochastic fluctuations in their speed. Such a stochastic deviation from the well-measured speed of light at low photon energies, c, should be contrasted with the possibility of an energy-dependent systematic, deterministic deviation. Such a systematic deviation, on which observations by the Fermi satellite set Planck-scale limits for linear energy dependence2, is more easily searched for than stochastic deviations. Here, for the first time, we place Planck-scale limits on the more generic spacetime-foam prediction of energy-dependent fuzziness in the speed of photons. Using high-energy observations from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) of gamma-ray burst GRB090510, we test a model in which photon speeds are distributed normally around c with a standard deviation proportional to the photon energy.

Here we show by direct experimental measurement that these two mechanisms are insufficient to explain force patterns observed during wound closure. At early stages of the process, leading actin protrusions generate traction forces that point away from the wound, showing that wound closure is initially driven by cell crawling. At later stages, we observed unanticipated patterns of traction forces pointing towards the wound. Such patterns have strong force components that are both radial and tangential to the wound. We show that these force components arise from tensions transmitted by a heterogeneous actomyosin ring to the underlying substrate through focal adhesions.

To obtain such a control an interaction between the components needs to be established. For coupling the magnetic properties, an exchange interaction has to be implemented which typically depends on wavefunction overlap and is therefore short-ranged, so that it may be compromised across the hybrid interface. Here we study a hybrid structure consisting of a ferromagnetic Co layer and a semiconducting CdTe quantum well, separated by a thin (Cd, Mg)Te barrier. In contrast to the expected p–d exchange that decreases exponentially with the wavefunction overlap of quantum well holes and magnetic atoms, we find a long-ranged, robust coupling that does not vary with barrier width up to more than 30 nm. We suggest that the resulting spin polarization of acceptor-bound holes is induced by an effective p–d exchange that is mediated by elliptically polarized phonons.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26946413@NATURE_PHYSICS
2014@Лю Л|Сун Ж З|Чен Ц Т|@Spin Hall effect tunnelling spectroscopy@12@The spin Hall effect (SHE) and its inverse have been widely used to generate and detect spin currents1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. To date, most experiments focus only on characterizing electrons near the Fermi surface4,5,6,7,8, whereas the SHE, which originates from the spin–orbit interaction, is expected to be energy dependent9,10. Here, we report a tunnelling spectroscopy technique developed to measure the SHE under finite bias voltages. We studied the SHE for typical 5d transition metals. At zero d.c. bias, the obtained spin Hall angles confirm the results from spin-torque experiments8,11,12,13. At high bias, the transverse spin Hall signals of these materials exhibit very different voltage dependences. The SHE tunnelling spectra have important implications in pinpointing the mechanisms of the SHE and provide guidelines for engineering high-SHE materials. Moreover, SHE tunnelling spectroscopy can be directly applied to two-dimensional surface states with strong spin–orbit coupling, such as Dirac electrons in topological insulators.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31740849@NATURE_PHYSICS

These processes are relevant over a wide range of conditions, from cosmic ray acceleration and gamma ray bursts to nuclear fusion in stars. The disparate temporal and spatial scales where each process operates can be reconciled by scaling parameters that enable one to emulate astrophysical conditions in the laboratory. Here we unveil a new mechanism by which the flow of ultra-energetic particles in a laser-wakefield accelerator strongly magnetizes the boundary between plasma and non-ionized gas. We demonstrate, from time-resolved large-scale magnetic-field measurements and full-scale particle-in-cell simulations, the generation of strong magnetic fields up to 10–100 tesla (corresponding to nT in astrophysical conditions). These results open new paths for the exploration and modelling of ultrahigh-energy particle-driven magnetic-field generation in the laboratory.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24486975@NATURE_PHYSICS

Atomic force experiments4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 have provided a wealth of results on the dependence of nanofriction on structure5,6, velocity7,8,9,10 and temperature11,12,13, but limitations in the dynamic range, time resolution, and control at the single-atom level have hampered a description from first principles3. Here, using an ion-crystal system with single-atom, single-substrate-site spatial and single-slip temporal resolution15,16, we measure the friction force over nearly five orders of magnitude in velocity, and contiguously observe four distinct regimes, while controlling temperature and dissipation. We elucidate the interplay between thermal and structural lubricity for two coupled atoms, and provide a simple explanation in terms of the Peierls–Nabarro potential17. This extensive control at the atomic scale enables fundamental studies of the interaction of many-atom surfaces, possibly into the quantum regime.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=25177723@NATURE_PHYSICS

In quantum liquids, rotons arise from the strong interparticle interactions, whose microscopic description remains debated 2. In the realm of highly controllable quantum gases, a roton mode has been predicted to emerge due to magnetic dipole-dipole interactions despite their weakly interacting character 3. This prospect has raised considerable interest 4-12 ; yet roton modes in dipolar quantum gases have remained elusive to observations. Here we report experimental and theoretical studies of the momentum distribution in Bose-Einstein condensates of highly magnetic erbium atoms, revealing the existence of the long-sought roton mode. Following an interaction quench, the roton mode manifests itself with the appearance of symmetric peaks at well-defined finite momentum. The roton momentum follows the predicted geometrical scaling with the inverse of the confinement length along the magnetization axis. From the growth of the roton population, we probe the roton softening of the excitation spectrum in time and extract the corresponding imaginary roton gap. Our results provide a further step in the quest towards supersolidity in dipolar quantum gases 13.

Extremely localized transient electric fields on the nanoscale can be achieved by coupling picosecond duration terahertz pulses to metallic nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate terahertz scanning tunnelling microscopy (THz-STM) in ultrahigh vacuum as a new platform for exploring ultrafast non-equilibrium tunnelling dynamics with atomic precision. Extreme terahertz-pulse-driven tunnel currents up to 107 times larger than steady-state currents in conventional STM are used to image individual atoms on a silicon surface with 0.3 nm spatial resolution. At terahertz frequencies, the metallic-like Si(111)-(7 × 7) surface is unable to screen the electric field from the bulk, resulting in a terahertz tunnel conductance that is fundamentally different than that of the steady state. Ultrafast terahertz-induced band bending and non-equilibrium charging of surface states opens new conduction pathways to the bulk, enabling extreme transient tunnel currents to flow between the tip and sample.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31886321@NATURE_PHYSICS

Owing to extremely short time and length scales, the measurement and manipulation of electron thermalization in nanoscale devices remains challenging even with the most advanced ultrafast laser techniques8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here, we overcome this challenge by leveraging the atomic thinness of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials to introduce a highly tunable electron transfer pathway that directly competes with electron thermalization. We realize this scheme in a graphene–boron nitride–graphene (G–BN–G) vdW heterostructure15,16,17, through which optically excited carriers are transported from one graphene layer to the other. By applying an interlayer bias voltage or varying the excitation photon energy, interlayer carrier transport can be controlled to occur faster or slower than the intralayer scattering events, thus effectively tuning the electron thermalization pathways in graphene. Our findings, which demonstrate a means to probe and directly modulate electron energy transport in nanoscale materials, represent a step towards designing and implementing optoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices with tailored microscopic properties.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26830491@NATURE_PHYSICS

However, the exact location and size of the γ-ray emitting part of the jets is uncertain2,3,4,5,6. The main difficulty is the very small angular size of these sources, beyond the angular resolution of γ-ray telescopes. Here, we report a measurement of the projected size of the γ-ray jet, revealed by the detection of microlensing in the gravitationally lensed blazar PKS 1830-211. This measurement is consistent with a constraint from the intrinsic variability timescale of the blazar. Our measurement shows that the γ-ray emission originates from the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole. Combining the X-ray and γ-ray data, we use the microlensing effect to constrain the size of the X-ray source. We show that the effect of pair production of γ-rays on X-ray photons does not make the source opaque, owing to the large size of the X-ray emission region.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24453411@NATURE_PHYSICS

These Goldstone modes can become the dominant low-energy excitation, showing that symmetry breaking has a profound impact on the physical properties of matter.

Quantum phenomena such as Bose–Einstein condensation, superfluidity, quantized vortices, and macroscopic quantum states have been realized at temperatures from tens of kelvin up to room temperatures. Crucially, many of these effects of exciton–polaritons depend on the polariton–polariton interaction strength. Despite the importance of this parameter, it has been difficult to make an accurate experimental measurement, mostly because of the difficulty in determining the absolute densities of polaritons and bare excitons. Here we report a direct measurement of the polariton–polariton interaction strength in a very high-Q microcavity structure. By allowing polaritons to propagate over 20 μm to the centre of a laser-generated annular trap, we are able to separate the polariton–polariton interactions from polariton–exciton interactions. The interaction strength is deduced from the energy renormalization of the polariton dispersion as the polariton density is increased, using the polariton condensation as a benchmark for the density. We find that the interaction strength is about two orders of magnitude larger than previous theoretical estimates, putting polaritons in the strongly interacting regime.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=32032714@NATURE_PHYSICS

In the cold collisions regime, quantization of the intermolecular degrees of freedom leads to quantum scattering resonances. Although these states have been shown to be sensitive to details of the interaction potential3,4,5,6,7,8, the effect of anisotropy on quantum resonances has so far eluded experimental observation. Here, we directly measure the anisotropy in atom–molecule interactions via quantum resonances by changing the quantum state of the internal molecular rotor. We observe that a quantum scattering resonance at a collision energy of kB × 270 mK appears in the Penning ionization of molecular hydrogen with metastable helium only if the molecule is rotationally excited.

When an electron is injected into a TL liquid, it transforms into charge- and spin-density wavepackets that propagate at different group velocities and move away from each other. This process, known as spin–charge separation, is the hallmark of TL physics. While spin–charge separation has been probed in momentum- or frequency-domain measurements in various 1D systems5,6,7,8,9, waveforms of separated excitations, which are a direct manifestation of the TL behaviour, have been long awaited to be measured. Here, we present a waveform measurement for the pseudospin–charge separation process in a chiral TL liquid comprising quantum Hall edge channels9,10,11,12,13. The charge- and pseudospin-density waveforms are captured by utilizing a spin-resolved sampling scope that records the spin-up or -down component of the excitations.

Applying this concept to oxides in which interfaces can be polar and cations may adopt a mixed valence has led to the discovery of novel two-dimensional states between simple band insulators such as LaAlO3 and SrTiO3. However, many oxides have a more complex electronic structure, with charge, orbital and/or spin orders arising from strong Coulomb interactions at and between transition metal and oxygen ions. Such electronic correlations offer a rich playground to engineer functional interfaces but their compatibility with the classical band alignment picture remains an open question. Here we show that beyond differences in electron affinities and polar effects, a key parameter determining charge transfer at correlated oxide interfaces is the energy required to alter the covalence of the metal–oxygen bond. Using the perovskite nickelate (RNiO3) family as a template, we probe charge reconstruction at interfaces with gadolinium titanate GdTiO3. X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the charge transfer is thwarted by hybridization effects tuned by the rare-earth (R) size. Charge transfer results in an induced ferromagnetic-like state in the nickelate, exemplifying the potential of correlated interfaces to design novel phases. Further, our work clarifies strategies to engineer two-dimensional systems through the control of both doping and covalence.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26844871@NATURE_PHYSICS

Initially confined to points, extensions of the Dirac dispersion to lines, and even loops, have now been uncovered, and semimetals hosting such features have been identified. However, experimental evidence for the enhanced correlation effects predicted to occur in these topological semimetals has been lacking. Here, we report a quantum oscillation study of the nodal-loop semimetal ZrSiS in high magnetic fields that reveals significant enhancement in the effective mass of the quasiparticles residing near the nodal loop. Above a threshold field, magnetic breakdown occurs across gaps in the loop structure with orbits that enclose different windings around its vertices, each winding accompanied by an additional π Berry phase. The amplitudes of these breakdown orbits exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence. These findings demonstrate the emergence of novel, correlation-driven physics in ZrSiS associated with the Dirac-like quasiparticles.

Although graphene is very promising for spin communication due to its extraordinary electron mobility, the lack of a bandgap restricts its prospects for semiconducting spin devices such as spin diodes and bipolar spin transistors. The recent emergence of two-dimensional semiconductors could help overcome this basic challenge. In this letter we report an important step towards making two-dimensional semiconductor spin devices. We have fabricated a spin valve based on ultrathin (∼5 nm) semiconducting black phosphorus (bP), and established fundamental spin properties of this spin channel material, which supports all electrical spin injection, transport, precession and detection up to room temperature. In the non-local spin valve geometry we measure Hanle spin precession and observe spin relaxation times as high as 4 ns, with spin relaxation lengths exceeding 6 μm. Our experimental results are in a very good agreement with first-principles calculations and demonstrate that the Elliott–Yafet spin relaxation mechanism is dominant.

Moreover, our device heterostructure geometry and materials enable us to measure the Andreev spectrum as a function of the graphene Fermi energy, showing a transition between different mesoscopic regimes. Furthermore, by experimentally introducing a novel concept, the supercurrent spectral density, we determine the supercurrent–phase relation in a tunnelling experiment, thus establishing the connection between Andreev physics at finite energy and the Josephson effect.

It is well accepted that both the plasma density and the magnitude of the magnetic field strength decrease rapidly away from the solar surface, making high-cadence coronal measurements through traditional Zeeman and Hanle effects difficult as the observational signatures are fraught with low-amplitude signals that can become swamped with instrumental noise2,3. Magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) techniques have previously been applied to coronal structures, with single and spatially isolated magnetic field strengths estimated as 9–55 G (refs 4,5,6,7). A drawback with previous MHD approaches is that they rely on particular wave modes alongside the detectability of harmonic overtones. Here we show, for the first time, how omnipresent magneto-acoustic waves, originating from within the underlying sunspot and propagating radially outwards, allow the spatial variation of the local coronal magnetic field to be mapped with high precision. We find coronal magnetic field strengths of 32 ± 5 G above the sunspot, which decrease rapidly to values of approximately 1 G over a lateral distance of 7,000 km, consistent with previous isolated and unresolved estimations.

In gravitational-wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO, both contributions can be simultaneously squeezed in a broad frequency band by injecting a spectrum of squeezed vacuum states with a frequency-dependent squeeze angle. This approach requires setting up an additional long baseline, low-loss filter cavity in a vacuum system at the detector’s site. Here, we show that the need for such a filter cavity can be eliminated, by exploiting Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR)-entangled signals and idler beams. By harnessing their mutual quantum correlations and the difference in the way each beam propagates in the interferometer, we can engineer the input signal beam to have the appropriate frequency-dependent conditional squeezing once the out-going idler beam is detected. Our proposal is appropriate for all future gravitational-wave detectors for achieving sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=32061414@NATURE_PHYSICS

Recent studies have focused on coupling s-wave superconductors to systems with an unusual configuration of electronic spin and momentum at the Fermi surface, where the nature of the paired state can be modified and the system may even undergo a topological phase transition. Here we present measurements and theoretical calculations of HgTe quantum wells coupled to aluminium or niobium superconductors and subject to a magnetic field in the plane of the quantum well. We find that this magnetic field tunes the momentum of Cooper pairs in the quantum well, directly reflecting the response of the spin-dependent Fermi surfaces. In the high electron density regime, the induced superconductivity evolves with electron density in agreement with our model based on the Hamiltonian of Bernevig, Hughes and Zhang. This agreement provides a quantitative value for g ̃/vF, where g ̃ is the effective g-factor and vF is the Fermi velocity. Our new understanding of the interplay between spin physics and superconductivity introduces a way to spatially engineer the order parameter from singlet to triplet pairing, and in general allows investigation of electronic spin texture at the Fermi surface of materials.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29557298@NATURE_PHYSICS

Among promising materials are spin-frustrated Mott insulators near the insulator-metal transition, where theory predicts a Fermi surface associated with neutral low-energy excitations. Here we reveal another route to experimentally realize a Fermi surface in the absence of a Fermi liquid by the experimental study of a Kondo insulator SmB 6 positioned close to the insulator-metal transition. We present experimental signatures down to low temperatures (≤1 K) associated with a Fermi surface in the bulk, including a sizeable linear specific heat coefficient, and on the application of a finite magnetic field, bulk magnetic quantum oscillations, finite quantum oscillatory entropy, and substantial enhancement in thermal conductivity well below the charge gap energy scale. Thus, the weight of evidence indicates that despite an extreme instance of Fermi liquid breakdown in Kondo insulating SmB 6, a Fermi surface arises from novel itinerant low-energy excitations that couple to magnetic fields, but not weak DC electric fields.

In these systems, droplets grow by the addition of droplet material generated by chemical reactions. Surprisingly, we find that chemically driven droplet growth can lead to shape instabilities that trigger the division of droplets into two smaller daughters.

Regardless of the band topology, however, any non-zero Berry curvature can have important consequences, such as in the semi-classical evolution of a coherent wavepacket. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the wavepacket dynamics can be used to directly map out the Berry curvature. To this end, we use optical pulses in two coupled fibre loops to study the discrete time evolution of a wavepacket in a one-dimensional geometric ‘charge’ pump, where the Berry curvature leads to an anomalous displacement of the wavepacket.

These nodal chains are protected by mirror symmetry and have a frequency variation of less than 1%. We use angle-resolved transmission measurements to probe the projected bulk dispersion and perform Fourier-transformed field scans to map out the dispersion of the drumhead surface state.

Recently, a series of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments3,4,5,6,7,8,9 have revealed that deeply underdoped cuprates exhibit a particle–hole symmetric3 superconducting-like energy gap at the momentum–space locations where the dx2−y2 gap nodes are expected. Here we discuss the possibility that this phenomenon is caused by a fully gapped topological superconducting state that coexists with the antiferromagnetic order. If experimentally confirmed, this result will completely change our view of how exactly the high-temperature superconductivity state evolves from the insulating antiferromagnet.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=28217288@NATURE_PHYSICS

Matter-wave interferometers enable the use of probe masses as small as neutrons2, atoms3 and molecular clusters4, but still require fields generated by masses ranging from hundreds of kilograms5,6 to the entire Earth. Shrinking the sources would enable versatile configurations, improve positioning accuracy, enable tests for beyond-standard-model (‘fifth’) forces, and allow observation of non-classical effects of gravity. Here we detect the gravitational force between freely falling caesium atoms and an in-vacuum, miniature (centimetre-sized, 0.19 kg) source mass using atom interferometry. Sensitivity down to gravitational strength forces accesses the natural scale7 for a wide class of cosmologically motivated scalar field models8,9 of modified gravity and dark energy.

Techniques such as four-wave mixing and spectral hole-burning are used in optical spectroscopy1,2,3, and spin-echo4 in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). However, the high-power pulses used in spin-echo and other sequences4,5,6,7,8 often create spurious dynamics7,8 obscuring the subtle spin correlations important for quantum technologies5,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we develop NMR techniques to probe the correlation times of the fluctuations in a nuclear spin bath of individual quantum dots, using frequency-comb excitation, allowing for the homogeneous NMR lineshapes to be measured without high-power pulses. We find nuclear spin correlation times exceeding one second in self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots—four orders of magnitude longer than in strain-free III–V semiconductors. This observed freezing of the nuclear spin fluctuations suggests ways of designing quantum dot spin qubits with a well-understood, highly stable nuclear spin bath.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27081710@NATURE_PHYSICS

Here we report the first direct optical observation of the spontaneous formation of half-skyrmions. In a thin film of a chiral liquid crystal, depending on experimental conditions including film thickness, they form a hexagonal lattice whose lattice constant is a few hundred nanometres, or appear as isolated entities with topological defects compensating their charge. These half-skyrmions exhibit intriguing dynamical behaviour driven by thermal fluctuations. Numerical calculations of real-space images successfully corroborate the experimental observations despite the challenge because of the characteristic scale of the structures close to the optical resolution limit. A thin film of a chiral liquid crystal thus offers an intriguing platform that facilitates a direct investigation of the dynamics of topological excitations such as half-skyrmions and their manipulation with optical techniques.

Antiferromagnetic materials, on the other hand, are far less utilized, despite having some appealing features. For instance, the absence of net magnetization and stray fields eliminates crosstalk between neighbouring devices, and the absence of a primary macroscopic magnetization makes spin manipulation in antiferromagnets inherently faster than in ferromagnets. However, control of spins in antiferromagnets requires exceedingly high magnetic fields, and antiferromagnetic order cannot be detected with conventional magnetometry. Here we provide an overview and illustrative examples of how electromagnetic radiation can be used for probing and modification of the magnetic order in antiferromagnets. We also discuss possible research directions that are anticipated to be among the main topics defining the future of this rapidly developing field.

When such a transition is tuned to zero temperature in clean materials, the growth of low-energy zero-point fluctuations potentially drives an array of phenomena, including the formation of novel states such as non-conventional superconductivity. Experimentally, the growth of the fluctuations, however, is curtailed and the transition becomes discontinuous as its temperature is reduced. This is understood to arise from non-analytic corrections to the free energy that always occur1. In a recent theory2,3, changes of the excitation spectrum are self-consistently considered alongside the ground state. This analysis reveals that a transition to a new state may be an alternative outcome. As the excitation spectrum (the ‘disorder’) is pivotal to promoting the new ‘order’ this mechanism is referred to as ‘order by disorder’. Here, we report the discovery of modulated order in PrPtAl, consistent with complex spirals, at the boundary between paramagnetism and ferromagnetism, giving the first clear experimental realization of such a state.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24426900@NATURE_PHYSICS

From early experimental results1,2,3,4, the QCPT in the Kondo-lattice compound YbRh2Si2 is not a case of the ordinary spin density wave (SDW) instability observed in Ce-based Kondo lattices5, but a candidate for a novel locally critical case6,7,8. Here, we observe that coexisting, static Fermi liquid (FL) and non-Fermi liquid (NFL) states are a key feature of the QCPT in YbRh2Si2. By means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin–lattice relaxation time (T1) measurements on a single-crystalline sample, we find that the FL and NFL states are invariant, whereas their ratio in a crossover is field dependent near the QCPT. Such a pair of states has remained hidden in Ce compounds, owing presumably to the short lifetimes of the two states. We derive a scaling law for the occupation ratio of the two states, which could be widely applicable to Kondo-lattice systems.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24740697@NATURE_PHYSICS

Such level repulsion, or avoided level crossing, is commonly used to describe the dispersion relation of quasiparticles in solids2. However, little is known about the level repulsion when more than two quasiparticles are present; for example, in a strongly interacting quantum system where a quasiparticle can spontaneously decay into a many-particle continuum3,4,5. Here we show that even in this case level repulsion exists between a long-lived quasiparticle state and a continuum. In our fine-resolution neutron spectroscopy study of magnetic quasiparticles in the frustrated quantum magnet BiCu2PO6, we observe a renormalization of the quasiparticle dispersion relation due to the presence of the continuum of multi-quasiparticle states.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31888655@NATURE_PHYSICS

Here we show dramatic effects of spin transport through an amorphous magnetic insulator, which is both magnetically and structurally disordered. We observe spin flow though amorphous yttrium-iron-garnet (a-YIG) thin films in a non-local geometry by use of the spin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects in platinum strips separated by ten or more micrometres. By comparing a-YIG grown on suspended micromachined thermal isolation platforms to the same film on bulk substrates, we show strong effects of in-plane thermal gradients on spin transport in the disordered film. The resulting signals are orders of magnitude larger than those seen in crystalline magnetic insulators, and easily measurable even for distances greater than 100 μm. In analogy to heat transport in glasses, where a range of vibrational excitations can allow large thermal conductivities, we suggest that efficient spin transport in disordered systems can occur via a similar spectrum of excitations that relies on strong local exchange interactions and does not require long-range order. This opens a new area for experimental and theoretical studies of spin transport, and sets a new direction in materials science for magnonic and spintronic devices.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=32176329@NATURE_PHYSICS

Although the CDW had been predicted by theory11,12,13, important questions remain about the extent to which the CDW influences lattice and charge degrees of freedom and its characteristics as functions of doping and temperature. These questions are intimately connected to the origin of the CDW and its relation to the mysterious cuprate pseudogap10,14. Here, we use ultrahigh-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to reveal new CDW character in underdoped Bi2.2Sr1.8Ca0.8Dy0.2Cu2O8+δ.

M81∗ is one of the nearest low-luminosity jets and it emitted an extremely large radio flare in 2011, allowing us to study compact core emission with unprecedented sensitivity and linear resolution. Using a multiwavelength campaign, we were able to track the flare as it re-brightened and became optically thick. Simultaneous X-ray observations indicated that the radio re-brightening was preceded by a low-energy X-ray flare at least 12 days earlier. Associating the time delay (tdelay) between the two bands with the cooling time in a synchrotron flare4,5, we find that the magnetic field strength was 1.9 < B < 9.2 G, which is consistent with magnetic field estimate from spectral energy distribution modelling6, B < 10.2 G. In addition, Very Long Baseline Array observations at 23 GHz clearly illustrate a discrete knot moving at a low relativistic speed of vapp/c = 0.51 ± 0.17 associated with the initial radio flare. The observations indicate radial jet motions for the first time in M81∗. This has profound implications for jet production, as it means radial motion can be observed in even the lowest-luminosity AGN, but at slower velocities and smaller radial extents (≍104 RG).@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26971411@NATURE_PHYSICS

How noise-induced dynamics at the local level coexists with regular oscillations at the global level is still unclear. Here we show that a combination of stochastic recurrence-based initiation with deterministic refractoriness in an excitable network can reconcile these two features, leading to maximum collective coherence for an intermediate noise level. We report this behaviour in the slow oscillation regime exhibited by a cerebral cortex network under dynamical conditions resembling slow-wave sleep and anaesthesia. Computational analysis of a biologically realistic network model reveals that an intermediate level of background noise leads to quasi-regular dynamics. We verify this prediction experimentally in cortical slices subject to varying amounts of extracellular potassium, which modulates neuronal excitability and thus synaptic noise. The model also predicts that this effectively regular state should exhibit noise-induced memory of the spatial propagation profile of the collective oscillations, which is also verified experimentally. Taken together, these results allow us to construe the high regularity observed experimentally in the brain as an instance of collective stochastic coherence.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=28206182@NATURE_PHYSICS

The theoretical foundation of SFI was pioneered in the 1960s, and later refined by various analytical models. While asymptotic ionization rates predicted by these models have been tested to be in reasonable agreement for a wide range of laser parameters, predictions for SFI on the sub-laser-cycle timescale are either beyond the scope of the models or show strong qualitative deviations from full quantum-mechanical simulations. Here, using the unprecedented state specificity of attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we follow the real-time SFI process of the two valence spin–orbit states of xenon. The results reveal that the irreversible tunnelling contribution is accompanied by a reversible electronic population that exhibits an observable spin–orbit-dependent phase delay. A detailed theoretical analysis attributes this observation to transient ground-state polarization, an unexpected facet of SFI that cannot be captured by existing analytical models that focus exclusively on the production of asymptotic electron/ion yields.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31916074@NATURE_PHYSICS

Despite its technological importance, however, the physics behind this process has remained elusive. By studying the kinetic pathway of crystal nucleation and growth at a single-particle level both experimentally and numerically, we reveal that the keys to substrate-induced monomorphic single-crystal formation are matching of the angular symmetry between locally favoured structures formed in a supercooled liquid and the most stable crystal and non-trivial coupling of the former to substrate-induced layering in the liquid. These two conditions are crucial for direct formation of the most stable crystal while keeping its unique direction relative to the substrate. We also discuss special features of charged systems.

The trapping mechanism relies on the interaction between a dipole and the electric field of laser light. In atom trapping, the dominant contribution to the associated force typically comes from the allowed optical transition closest to the laser wavelength, whereas for mesoscopic particles it is given by the polarizability of the bulk material. Here, we show that for nanoscale diamond crystals containing a large number of artificial atoms, nitrogen–vacancy colour centres, the contributions from both the nanodiamond and the colour centres to the optical trapping strength can be simultaneously observed in a noisy liquid environment. For wavelengths around the zero-phonon line transition of the colour centres, we observe a 10% increase of overall trapping strength. The magnitude of this effect suggests that due to the large density of centres, cooperative effects between the artificial atoms contribute to the observed modification of the trapping strength.

generation energetic ions multi-ion plasmas radio-frequency heating@6@We describe a new technique for the efficient generation of high-energy ions with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves in multi-ion plasmas. The discussed ‘three-ion’ scenarios are especially suited for strong wave absorption by a very low number of resonant ions. To observe this effect, the plasma composition has to be properly adjusted, as prescribed by theory. We demonstrate the potential of the method on the world-largest plasma magnetic confinement device, JET (Joint European Torus, Culham, UK), and the high-magnetic-field tokamak Alcator C-Mod (Cambridge, USA). The obtained results demonstrate efficient acceleration of 3He ions to high energies in dedicated hydrogen–deuterium mixtures. Simultaneously, effective plasma heating is observed, as a result of the slowing-down of the fast 3He ions. The developed technique is not only limited to laboratory plasmas, but can also be applied to explain observations of energetic ions in space-plasma environments, in particular, 3He-rich solar flares.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=32109426@NATURE_PHYSICS

What is difficult to parse, however, is whether the charge order originates among the itinerant electrons or whether it arises from the ionic lattice. Here we employ high-resolution X-ray diffraction, combined with high-pressure and low-temperature techniques and theoretical modelling, to trace the evolution of the ordering wavevector Q in charge and spin density wave systems at the approach to both thermal and quantum phase transitions. The non-monotonic behaviour of Q with pressure and the limiting sinusoidal form of the density wave point to the dominant role of the itinerant instability in the vicinity of the critical points, with little influence from the lattice. Fluctuations rather than disorder seem to disrupt coherence.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31780867@NATURE_PHYSICS

However, to unlock their potential for cross-disciplinary applications such as relativistic geodesy 11, a major challenge remains: their transformation from highly specialized instruments restricted to national metrology laboratories into flexible devices deployable in different locations 12-14. Here, we report the first field measurement campaign with a transportable 87Sr optical lattice clock 12. We use it to determine the gravity potential difference between the middle of a mountain and a location 90 km away, exploiting both local and remote clock comparisons to eliminate potential clock errors. A local comparison with a 171Yb lattice clock 15 also serves as an important check on the international consistency of independently developed optical clocks. This campaign demonstrates the exciting prospects for transportable optical clocks.

2018@Вадлеы П|Зелезный Ж|Олейник К|Охно Х|Хоффманн А|@Spin transport spin torque antiferromagnetic devices@6@"Ferromagnets are key materials for sensing and memory applications. In contrast, antiferromagnets, which represent the more common form of magnetically ordered materials, have found less practical application beyond their use for establishing reference magnetic orientations via exchange bias. This might change in the future due to the recent progress in materials research and discoveries of antiferromagnetic spintronic phenomena suitable for device applications. Experimental demonstration of the electrical switching and detection of the Neél order open a route towards memory devices based on antiferromagnets. Apart from the radiation and magnetic-field hardness, memory cells fabricated from antiferromagnets can be inherently multilevel, which could be used for neuromorphic computing. Switching speeds attainable in antiferromagnets far exceed those of ferromagnetic and semiconductor memory technologies. Here, we review the recent progress in electronic spin-transport and spin-torque phenomena in antiferromagnets that are dominantly of the relativistic quantum-mechanical origin. We discuss their utility in pure antiferromagnetic or hybrid ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic memory devices.

The spatial extent of the latter is related to transport properties, including superconductivity, and to the dispersion relation of spin excitations (magnons). Here, for three antiferromagnetic parent compounds (single-layer Bi 2 Sr 0.9 La 1.1 CuO 6+, double-layer Nd 1.2 Ba 1.8 Cu 3 O 6 and infinite-layer CaCuO 2) differing by the number of apical atoms, we compare the magnetic spectra measured by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering over a significant portion of the reciprocal space and with unprecedented accuracy. We observe that the absence of apical oxygens increases the in-plane hopping range and, in CaCuO 2, it leads to a genuine three-dimensional (3D) exchange-bond network. These results establish a corresponding relation between the exchange interactions and the crystal structure, and provide fresh insight into the materials dependence of the superconducting transition temperature.

One of its most significant findings was the unanticipated displacement of the barium ion ‘comet head’ (and an oppositely directed deflection of the streaming hydrogen ions) transverse to both the solar wind flow and the interplanetary magnetic field, defying the conventional expectation that the barium ions would simply move downwind4. While subsequent theoretical and computational efforts5,6,7 to understand the cause of the transverse motion reached differing conclusions, several authors5 attributed the observations to Larmor coupling8,9, a collisionless momentum exchange mechanism believed to occur in various astrophysical and space-plasma environments10,11 and to participate in cosmic magnetized collisionless shock formation12,13,14. Here we present the detection of Larmor coupling in a reproducible laboratory experiment that combines an explosive laser-produced plasma cloud with preformed, magnetized ambient plasma in a parameter regime relevant to the AMPTE barium releases. In our experiment, time-resolved Doppler spectroscopy reveals ambient ion acceleration transverse to both the laser-produced plasma flow and the background magnetic field. Utilizing a detailed numerical simulation, we demonstrate that the ambient ion velocity distribution corresponding to the measured Doppler-shifted spectrum is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with Larmor coupling.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31930471@NATURE_PHYSICS

We find that the application of a magnetic field results in a universal exponential-root field growth of magnetic current, thus confirming the microscopic Coulomb force between the magnetic monopole quasiparticles and establishing a magnetic analogue of the Poole–Frenkel effect. At temperatures above 300 mK, gradual restoration of kinetic monopole equilibria causes the non-Ohmic current to smoothly evolve into the high-field Wien effect2 for magnetic monopoles, as confirmed by comparison to a recent and rigorous theory of the Wien effect in spin ice17,18.

The ground state of an exactly solved Kitaev honeycomb model is perhaps its clearest example2.

Here, we demonstrate this kind of fractionalization in the Kitaev paramagnetic state of the honeycomb magnet α-RuCl3. The spin excitation gap determined by nuclear magnetic resonance consists of the predicted Majorana fermion contribution following the cube of the applied magnetic field2,4,5, and a finite zero-field contribution matching the predicted size of the gauge flux gap2,6.

The standard technique of chiral discrimination - photoabsorption circular dichroism - relies on the magnetic properties of a chiral medium and yields an extremely weak chiral response. Here, we propose and demonstrate an orders of magnitude more sensitive type of circular dichroism in neutral molecules: photoexcitation circular dichroism. This technique does not rely on weak magnetic effects, but takes advantage of the coherent helical motion of bound electrons excited by ultrashort circularly polarized light. It results in an ultrafast chiral response and the efficient excitation of a macroscopic chiral density in an initially isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We probe this excitation using linearly polarized laser pulses, without the aid of further chiral interactions. Our time-resolved study of vibronic chiral dynamics opens a way to the efficient initiation, control and monitoring of chiral chemical change in neutral molecules at the level of electrons.

This interaction, driven by the ponderomotive potential of the optical standing wave, was both studied theoretically and demonstrated experimentally for atoms and electrons. In the original version of the experiment, only the transverse momentum of particles was varied, but their energy and longitudinal momentum remained unchanged after the interaction. Here, we report on the generalization of the Kapitza-Dirac effect. We demonstrate that the energy of sub-relativistic electrons is strongly modulated on the few-femtosecond timescale via the interaction with a travelling wave created in vacuum by two colliding laser pulses at different frequencies. This effect extends the possibilities of temporal control of freely propagating particles with coherent light and can serve the attosecond ballistic bunching of electrons, or for the acceleration of neutral atoms or molecules by light.

Typical of a bulk insulating three-dimensional topological crystal are conducting two-dimensional surface states. This constitutes the topological bulk–boundary correspondence. Here, we establish that the electronic structure of bismuth, an element consistently described as bulk topologically trivial, is in fact topological and follows a generalized bulk–boundary correspondence of higher-order: not the surfaces of the crystal, but its hinges host topologically protected conducting modes. These hinge modes are protected against localization by time-reversal symmetry locally, and globally by the three-fold rotational symmetry and inversion symmetry of the bismuth crystal. We support our claim theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis is based on symmetry arguments, topological indices, first-principles calculations, and the recently introduced framework of topological quantum chemistry. We provide supporting evidence from two complementary experimental techniques. With scanning-tunnelling spectroscopy, we probe the signatures of the rotational symmetry of the one-dimensional states located at the step edges of the crystal surface. With Josephson interferometry, we demonstrate their universal topological contribution to the electronic transport. Our work establishes bismuth as a higher-order topological insulator.

Spatial light modulators enable one to synthesize (shape) the incident wavefront, optimizing the multipath interference to achieve a specific behaviour such as focusing light to a target region. However, the extent of achievable control is not known when the target region is much larger than the wavelength and contains many speckles. Here we show that for targets containing more than g speckles, where g is the dimensionless conductance, the extent of transmission control is substantially enhanced by the long-range mesoscopic correlations among the speckles. Using a filtered random matrix ensemble appropriate for coherent diffusion in open geometries, we predict the full distributions of transmission eigenvalues as well as universal scaling laws for statistical properties, in excellent agreement with our experiment.

The supercurrent, I, versus the phase, †, across the junction is called the current-phase relation (CPR). It can reveal not only the amplitude of the critical current, but also the number of modes and their transmission. We measured the CPR of many individual InAs nanowire Josephson junctions, one junction at a time. Both the amplitude and shape of the CPR varied between junctions, with small critical currents and skewed CPRs indicating few-mode junctions with high transmissions. In a gate-tunable junction, we found that the CPR varied with gate voltage: near the onset of supercurrent, we observed behaviour consistent with resonant tunnelling through a single, highly transmitting mode. The gate dependence is consistent with modelled subband structure that includes an effective tunnelling barrier due to an abrupt change in the Fermi level at the boundary of the gate-tuned region. These measurements of skewed, tunable, few-mode CPRs are promising both for applications that require anharmonic junctions and for Majorana readout proposals.

The thermal implications cover fundamental topics from quantum control of heat to quantum thermodynamics, with prospects of novel thermal machines and an ineluctably growing influence on nanocircuit engineering. Experimentally, the rare observations thus far include the universal thermal conductance quantum and heat interferometry. However, evidence for many-body thermal effects paving the way to markedly different heat and electrical behaviours in quantum circuits remains wanting. Here we report on the observation of the Coulomb blockade of electronic heat flow from a small metallic circuit node, beyond the widespread Wiedemann-Franz law paradigm. We demonstrate this thermal many-body phenomenon for perfect (ballistic) conduction channels to the node, where it amounts to the universal suppression of precisely one quantum of conductance for the transport of heat, but none for electricity. The inter-channel correlations that give rise to such selective heat current reduction emerge from local charge conservation, in the floating node over the full thermal frequency range (l∼temperature × k B/h). This observation establishes the different nature of the quantum laws for thermal transport in nanocircuits.

This reorganization of the high-energy degrees of freedom occurs at the critical doping pcr ≈ 0.16 irrespective of the temperature, and it can be well described by dynamical mean-field theory calculations.

These include an unconventional form1,2 of the 'leakage' mechanism- the Andreev reflection3-and the potential of supercurrent modulation through electrical gating4. Despite the interest of high-temperature superconductors in that context5,6, realizations have been exclusively based on low-temperature ones.

Creating van der Waals heterostructures by deterministically stacking individual monolayers can tune various properties via the choice of materials1 and the relative orientation of the layers2,3. In these structures, a new type of exciton emerges where the electron and hole are spatially separated into different layers. These interlayer excitons4–6 allow exploration of many-body quantum phenomena7,8 and are ideally suited for valleytronic applications9. A basic model of a fully spatially separated electron and hole stemming from the K valleys of the monolayer Brillouin zones is usually applied to describe such excitons. Here, we combine photoluminescence spectroscopy and first-principles calculations to expand the concept of interlayer excitons. We identify a partially charge-separated electron–hole pair in MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures where the hole resides at the Γ point and the electron is located in a K valley. We control the emission energy of this new type of momentum-space indirect, yet strongly bound exciton by variation of the relative orientation of the layers.

This picture was questioned after the discovery of intercalated or monolayer form of FeSe-based systems without hole pockets, which seemingly undermines the basis for spin-fluctuation theory and the idea of a sign-changing OP. Using the recently proposed phase-sensitive quasiparticle interference technique, here we show that in LiOH-intercalated FeSe compound the OP does change sign, albeit within the electronic pockets.

To understand stars, we must rely on nuclear reaction rate data obtained, up to now, under conditions very different from those of stellar cores. Here we show thermonuclear measurements of the 2 H(d, n) 3 He and 3 H(t,2n) 4 He S-factors at a range of densities (1.2-16 g cm '3) and temperatures (2.1-5.4 keV) that allow us to test the conditions of the hydrogen-burning phase of main-sequence stars. The relevant conditions are created using inertial-confinement fusion implosions at the National Ignition Facility. Our data agree within uncertainty with previous accelerator-based measurements and establish this approach for future experiments to measure other reactions and to test plasma-nuclear effects present in stellar interiors, such as plasma electron screening, directly in the environments where they occur.

However, since the Cherenkov angle depends only on the material’s permittivity, the material unavoidably sets a fundamental limit to the momentum coverage and sensitivity of Cherenkov detectors. For example, ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors must employ materials transparent to the frequency of interest as well as possessing permittivities close to unity to identify particles in the multi-gigaelectronvolt range, and thus are often limited to large gas chambers. It would be extremely important, albeit challenging, to lift this fundamental limit and control Cherenkov angles at will. Here we propose a new mechanism that uses the constructive interference of resonance transition radiation from photonic crystals to generate both forward and backward effective Cherenkov radiation. This mechanism can control the radiation angles in a flexible way with high sensitivity to any desired range of velocities. Photonic crystals thus overcome the material limit for Cherenkov detectors, enabling the use of transparent materials with arbitrary values of permittivity, and provide a promising versatile platform well suited for identification of particles at high energy with enhanced sensitivity.

An additional control laser addresses the atom and induces a tunable coupling between the modes, resulting in a doubly nonlinear energy-level structure of the photon–photon–atom system3–6.

Recent experiments showed that in thin systems cracks accelerate to nearly their limiting velocity without micro-branching, until undergoing an oscillatory instability. Despite their fundamental importance, these dynamic instabilities are not explained by the classical theory of cracks, which is based on linear elasticity and an extraneous local symmetry criterion to predict crack paths. We develop a two-dimensional theory for predicting arbitrary paths of ultrahigh-speed cracks, which incorporates elastic nonlinearity without extraneous criteria. We show that cracks undergo an oscillatory instability controlled by small-scale, near crack-tip, elastic nonlinearity. This instability occurs above an ultrahigh critical velocity and features an intrinsic wavelength proportional to the ratio of the fracture energy to the elastic modulus, in quantitative agreement with experiments. This ratio emerges as a fundamental scaling length assumed to play no role in the classical theory of cracks, but shown here to strongly influence crack dynamics.

Well-known examples include the unusual behaviour of supercooled water 2, the emergent ferroelectric ordering in ice films 4 and the fact that the 'ordinary' ice Ih floats on water. We report the intriguing observation that ice II, one of the high-pressure phases of ice, disappears in a selective fashion from water's phase diagram following the addition of small amounts of ammonium fluoride. This finding exposes the strict topologically constrained nature of the ice II hydrogen-bond network, which is not found for the competing phases. In analogy to the behaviour of frustrated magnets 5, the presence of the exceptional ice II is argued to have a wider impact on water's phase diagram, potentially explaining its general tendency to display anomalous behaviour. Furthermore, the impurity-induced disappearance of ice II raises the prospect that specific dopants may not only be able to suppress certain phases but also induce the formation of new phases of ice in future studies.

In magnetic insulators, owing to the magnetostrictive properties of materials, spin waves can become strongly coupled to elastic waves, forming magnetoelastic waves - a hybridized magnon-phonon excitation. While several aspects of this interaction have been subject to recent scrutiny, it remains unclear whether or not phonons can carry spin. Here we report experiments on a film of the ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet under a non-uniform magnetic field demonstrating the conversion of coherent magnons generated by a microwave field into phonons that have spin. While it is well established that photons in circularly polarized light carry a spin, the spin of phonons has had little attention in the literature. By means of wavevector-resolved Brillouin light-scattering measurements, we show that the magnon-phonon conversion occurs with constant energy and varying linear momentum, and that the light scattered by the phonons is circularly polarized, thus demonstrating that the phonons have spin.

This allows us to exclude the symmetron as the origin of dark energy for a large volume of the three-dimensional parameter space.

This changes when they are exposed to ultrashort and highly intense laser pulses. Different interaction mechanisms lead to the appearance of various transient nonlinear optical phenomena. Using these, the optical properties of dielectrics can be controlled from the transparent to the metal-like state. Here we expand this range by a yet unexplored mechanism in excited dielectrics: Amplification. In a two-colour pump-probe experiment, we show that a 400nm femtosecond laser pulse is coherently amplified inside an excited sapphire sample on a scale of a few micrometres. Simulations strongly support the proposed two-photon stimulated emission process, which is temporally and spatially controllable. Consequently, we expect applications in all fields that demand strongly localized amplification.

We further show that our findings agree with a semiclassical picture, in which the electron keeps part of that rotary motion on its way through the tunnel by measuring m-dependent modification of the electron emission pattern. These findings are relevant for attosecond metrology as well as for interpretation of strong-field electron emission from atoms and molecules 7-14 and directly demonstrate the creation of ring currents in bound states of ions with attosecond precision.

Under conditions where the X-ray signal comes from both the growth surface and the thin film bulk, oscillations in temporal correlations arise from coherent interference between scattering from stationary bulk features and from the advancing surface.

Although Fourier amplitudes are generally complex valued, earlier analysis primarily focused on their absolute values. Their complex phases were often deemed random, and thus irrelevant, due to the unknown positions of the impurities in the sample. Here we show how to factor out these random phases by analysing overlaps between Fourier amplitudes that differ by reciprocal lattice vectors. The resulting holographic maps provide important and previously unknown information about the electronic structures. When applied to superconducting cuprates, our method solves a long-standing puzzle of the dichotomy between equivalent wavevectors. We show that d-wave Wannier functions of the conduction band provide a natural explanation for experimental results that were interpreted as evidence for competing unconventional charge modulations.

They interconnect regions with different realizations of the broken symmetry, promoting structure formation from cosmological length scales to the atomic level 1,2. In ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials, domain walls with unique functionalities emerge, holding great promise for nanoelectronics and spintronics applications 3-5. These walls are usually of Ising, Bloch or Néel type and separate homogeneously ordered domains. Here we demonstrate that a wide variety of new domain walls occurs in the presence of spatially modulated domain states. Using magnetic force microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we show three fundamental classes of domain walls to arise in the near-room-temperature helimagnet iron germanium. In contrast to conventional ferroics, the domain walls exhibit a well-defined inner structure, which - analogous to cholesteric liquid crystals - consists of topological disclination and dislocation defects. Similar to the magnetic skyrmions that form in the same material 6,7, the domain walls can carry a finite topological charge, permitting an efficient coupling to spin currents and contributions to a topological Hall effect. Our study establishes a new family of magnetic nano-objects with non-trivial topology, opening the door to innovative device concepts based on helimagnetic domain walls.

Materials with several degenerate regions in the Brillouin zone—called valleys—offer a rich setting for the emergence of such states, which have potential electronic and optical applications1–4. To date, identification of these broken-symmetry phases has mostly relied on macroscopic transport or optical properties. Here we demonstrate a direct approach by visualizing the wavefunctions of bismuth surface states with a scanning tunnelling microscope. Strong spin–orbit coupling on the surface of bismuth leads to six degenerate, teardrop-shaped, hole valleys5. Our spectroscopic measurements reveal that exchange interactions fully lift this degeneracy at high magnetic field, and we are able to determine the nature of the valley ordering by imaging the broken-symmetry Landau level wavefunctions. The spatial features of singly degenerate Landau level wavefunctions near isolated defects contain unique signatures of interference between spin-textured valleys, which identify the electronic ground state as a quantum Hall ferroelectric. Our observations confirm the recent prediction6 that interactions in strongly anisotropic valley systems favour the occupation of a single valley, giving rise to emergent ferroelectricity in the surface state of bismuth.

Plasmas are said to be strongly coupled when interparticle potential energies are large compared to kinetic energies. Charged particles in such plasmas can behave collectively like liquids11,12, but with essential differences, such as long-range collisions13. It remains unexplored whether, despite these differences, the stochastic behaviour of strongly coupled plasmas will obey fluctuation theorems. Here we demonstrate experimentally that a strongly coupled dusty plasma obeys the fluctuation theorem of Evans, Cohen, and Morriss (ECM)14, which was developed for a simple liquid in a nonequilibrium steady state. This fluctuation theorem describes the entropy production arising from collisions in a steady laminar shear flow.

The pyrochlore iridate Eu2Ir2O7 shows a metal–insulator transition at TN ∼ 120 K below which a magnetically ordered state develops. Using torque magnetometry, we uncover an unusual magnetic response. A magnetic field H applied in its a–b plane produces a nonlinear magnetization M⊥ orthogonal to the plane. M⊥ displays a d-wave field-angle pattern consistent with octupolar order, with a handedness dictated by field cooling, leading to symmetry breaking of the chirality ω.

The fate behaviour of these cells is reflected in the time evolution of their progeny, termed clones, which serve as a key experimental observable. In adult tissues, where cell dynamics is constrained by the condition of homeostasis, clonal tracing studies based on transgenic animal models have advanced our understanding of cell fate behaviour and its dysregulation in disease 1,2. But what can be learnt from clonal dynamics in development, where the spatial cohesiveness of clones is impaired by tissue deformations during tissue growth? Drawing on the results of clonal tracing studies, we show that, despite the complexity of organ development, clonal dynamics may converge to a critical state characterized by universal scaling behaviour of clone sizes. By mapping clonal dynamics onto a generalization of the classical theory of aerosols, we elucidate the origin and range of scaling behaviours and show how the identification of universal scaling dependences may allow lineage-specific information to be distilled from experiments. Our study shows the emergence of core concepts of statistical physics in an unexpected context, identifying cellular systems as a laboratory to study non-equilibrium statistical physics.

At room temperature, a caesium atom scatters on average less than one of these blackbody radiation photons every 108 years. Thus, it is generally assumed that any scattering force exerted on atoms by such radiation is negligible. However, atoms also interact coherently with the thermal electromagnetic field. In this work, we measure an attractive force induced by blackbody radiation between a caesium atom and a heated, centimetre-sized cylinder, which is orders of magnitude stronger than the outward-directed radiation pressure. Using atom interferometry, we find that this force scales with the fourth power of the cylinder's temperature. The force is in good agreement with that predicted from an a.c. Stark shift gradient of the atomic ground state in the thermal radiation field 1. This observed force dominates over both gravity and radiation pressure, and does so for a large temperature range.

Herein, we present direct visualization of long-range ferromagnetic order in thin films of Cr and V co-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 using low-temperature magnetic force microscopy with in situ transport. The magnetization reversal process reveals typical ferromagnetic domain behaviour—that is, domain nucleation and possibly domain wall propagation—in contrast to much weaker magnetic signals observed in the endmembers, possibly due to superparamagnetic behaviour17–19.

These cases are unique and form the experimentally established foundation for our understanding of quantum critical phenomena. Here we report that a magnetic-field-driven QPT in superconducting nanowires—a prototypical one-dimensional system (d=1)—can be fully explained by the critical theory8,9 of pair-breaking transitions characterized by a correlation length exponent v≈1 and dynamic critical exponent z≈2. We find that in the quantum critical regime, the electrical conductivity is in agreement with a theoretically predicted scaling function and, moreover, that the theory quantitatively describes the dependence of conductivity on the critical temperature, field magnitude and orientation, nanowire cross-sectional area, and microscopic parameters of the nanowire material. At the critical field, the conductivity follows a T(d–2)/z dependence predicted by phenomenological scaling theories10,11 and more recently obtained within a holographic framework12. Our work uncovers the microscopic processes governing the transition: the pair-breaking effect of the magnetic field on interacting Cooper pairs overdamped by their coupling to electronic degrees of freedom.

Although the presence of these fluctuations is well established, they have not been locally imaged in space, and their local dynamics has not been studied so far. We use a scanning superconducting quantum interference device to image quantum fluctuations near the QPT from a superconductor to an insulator. We find fluctuations of the diamagnetic response in both space and time that survive well below the transition temperature, demonstrating their quantum nature. The fluctuations appear as telegraph-like noise with a range of characteristic times and a non-monotonic temperature dependence, revealing unexpected quantum granularity. The lateral dimension of these fluctuations grows towards criticality, offering a new measurable length scale. Our results provide physical insight into the reorganization of phases across a QPT, with implications for any theoretical description.

It is accepted that DNA lesions (single- and double-strand breaks, for example) are induced by secondary species such as radicals, ions and the abundant low-energy secondary electrons generated by the primary radiation. Particularly harmful are dense ionization clusters of several ionization processes within a volume typical for the biomolecular system. Here we report the observation of a damage mechanism in the form of a non-local autoionizing process called intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD). It directly involves DNA constituents or other organic molecules in an aqueous environment. The products are two energetic ions and three reactive secondary electrons that can cause further damage in their vicinity. Hydrogen-bonded complexes that consist of one tetrahydrofuran (THF) molecule—a surrogate of deoxyribose in the DNA backbone—and one water molecule are used as a model system. After electron impact ionization of the water molecule in the inner-valence shell the vacancy is filled by an outer-valence electron. The released energy is transferred across the hydrogen bridge and leads to ionization of the neighbouring THF molecule. This energy transfer from water to THF is faster than the otherwise occurring intermolecular proton transfer. The signature of the ICD reaction is identified in triple-coincidence measurements of both ions and one of the final state electrons. These results could improve the understanding of radiation damage in biological tissue.

Intensity effects in which the direction of light emission depends on the orientation of the external magnetic field are of particular interest, as they can be harnessed for routing light. Effects known so far for accomplishing such routing all control light emission along the axis parallel to the magnetic field. Here we report a new class of emission phenomena where directionality is established perpendicular to the externally applied magnetic field for light sources located in the vicinity of a surface. As a proof of principle for this effect, which we call transverse magnetic routing of light emission, we demonstrate the routing of emission for excitons in a diluted-magnetic-semiconductor quantum well. In hybrid plasmonic semiconductor structures, we observe significantly enhanced directionality of up to 60%.

Strong shocks are expected to accelerate particles to very high energies 4-6 ; however, they require a source of particles with velocities fast enough to permit multiple shock crossings. While the resulting diffusive shock acceleration 4 process can account for observations, the kinetic physics regulating the continuous injection of non-thermal particles is not well understood. Indeed, this injection problem is particularly acute for electrons, which rely on high-frequency plasma fluctuations to raise them above the thermal pool 7,8. Here we show, using laboratory laser-produced shock experiments, that, in the presence of a strong magnetic field, significant electron pre-heating is achieved. We demonstrate that the key mechanism in producing these energetic electrons is through the generation of lower-hybrid turbulence via shock-reflected ions. Our experimental results are analogous to many astrophysical systems, including the interaction of a comet with the solar wind 9, a setting where electron acceleration via lower-hybrid waves is possible.

We solve this long-standing problem with a top-down approach that utilizes spin–orbit coupling in the presence of a hidden SU(2) symmetry. We demonstrate giant AFM responses to sub-tesla external fields by exploiting the extremely strong two-dimensional critical fluctuations preserved under a symmetry-invariant exchange anisotropy, which is built into a square lattice artificially synthesized as a superlattice of SrIrO3 and SrTiO3.

In particular, non-equilibrium-state skyrmions, which are protected by topology and hence can exist over a wider temperature–magnetic-field region, show promise for possible practical applications, but their dynamics remain elusive. Here, we report the observation of a magnetic-field-induced dynamical transition from the metastable hexagonal-lattice skyrmion crystal (SkX) at a zero bias-field to an amorphous state via the densely vacancy-populated SkX. With decreasing field, on the other hand, the aggregate transforms from ‘random particles’ to ‘microcrystals’ of skyrmions in a non-equilibrium state, in analogy to colloidal crystallization, and subsequently undergoes a topologically distinct phase separation between the SkX and helical/conical domains accompanied by topological defects. These observations directly demonstrate the aggregation and collapse dynamics of metastable skyrmions and may provide a route to other nontrivial topological phenomena such as the zero-magnetic-field topological Hall effect.

All-dielectric metasurfaces exhibit high damage thresholds and strong enhancement of the driving field, making them attractive platforms to control high harmonics and other high-field processes at the nanoscale. Here we report enhanced non-perturbative high-harmonic emission from a Fano-resonant Si metasurface that possesses a classical analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency. The harmonic emission is enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude compared to unpatterned samples. The enhanced high harmonics are highly anisotropic with respect to the excitation polarization and are selective by the excitation wavelength due to its resonant features. By combining nanofabrication technology and ultrafast strong-field physics, our work paves the way for the design of new compact ultrafast photonic devices that operate under high intensities and at short wavelengths.

In this paper, it is demonstrated that a DB with hard type nonlinearity (DB2) can be excited in a Pt3Al nanofiber; this DB is localized on several light atoms, can move along the crystal, and has a frequency that lies above the phonon spectrum and increases with the DB amplitude. It is noteworthy that the presence of free surfaces of a nanofiber does not prevent the existence of DB1 and DB2 in it. Collisions of two DBs counterpropagating with equal velocities, as well as a collision of DB2 with a standing DB1, are considered. Two colliding DBs with hard type nonlinearity are repelled almost elastically, losing only insignificant part of their energy during the interaction. DB2 is also reflected from a standing DB1; in this case, the energy of the breathers is partially scattered into the Al sublattice. The results obtained indicate that DBs can transfer energy along a crystal over large distances. During the collision of two or more DBs, the energy localized in space can be as high as a few electron-volts; this allows one to raise the question of the participation of DBs in structural transformations of the crystal.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24950233@JETP

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are natural candidate sources for such neutrinos. To model the neutrino creation in AGNs, we study photopion production processes on the radiation field of the Shakura-Sunyaev accretion discs in the black hole vicinity.

An analytic model of liquid-metal splashing that includes two stages is proposed.

At the second stage, the axial symmetry is broken due to the development of the Plateau–Rayleigh instability in the upper part of the wall. The wall breakup process is shown to have a threshold. The minimal plasma pressure and the minimal electric current flowing through the crater required for obtaining the liquid-metal splashing regime are found.

The model is based on an assumption made on the character of binding between atoms in the gas phase near the critical point. This is the collective quantum cohesive energy, well-known in the theory of liquid alkali metals, which arises due to the appearance of conduction electrons and is extended to the gas region near the critical point. The parameters of the critical points of the transition and of the binodal are determined on the basis of the model calculation of the binding energy for all alkali metals. Combined, these parameters well agree with experimental results and the predictions made by other authors. The minimum metallic conductivity is evaluated. Its behavior allows one to conclude that vapor-liquid and insulator-metal transitions in alkali metal vapors coincide. This fact sheds light on the Zel’dovich-Landau problem as applied to alkali metal vapors.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=21877795@JETP

Both an initial powder with an average number of iron atoms N Fe ∼ 2000–2500 in a particle and this powder after annealing at 140°C for 3 h in air are investigated. The following substantial modifications of the magnetic properties of the ferrihydrite nanoparticles are detected after annealing: the superparamagnetic blocking temperature increases from 23 to 49.5 K, and the average magnetic moment of a particle increases (as follows from the results of processing of magnetization curves). The particles have antiferromagnetic ordering, and the magnetic moment resulting in the superparamagnetism of the system appears due to random spin decompensation inside the particle. For this mechanism, the number of uncompensated spins is proportional to the number of magnetically active atoms raised to the one-half power, and this relation holds true for the samples under study at a good accuracy. The possible causes of the detected shift of magnetic hysteresis loops at low temperatures upon field cooling are discussed.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24001311@JETP

This model is used to find the possibility of existing the following seven basic structural modifications of graphyne: α-, β1-, β2-, β3-, γ1-, γ2-, and γ3-graphyne. Polymorphic modifications β3 graphyne and γ3 graphyne are described. The basic structural modifications of graphyne contain diatomic polyyne chains and consist only of carbon atoms in two different crystallographically equivalent states. Other nonbasic structural modifications of graphyne can be formed via the elongation of the carbyne chains that connect three-coordinated carbon atoms and via the formation of graphyne layers with a mixed structure consisting of basic layer fragments, such as α-β-graphyne, α-γ-graphyne, and β-γ-graphyne. The semiempirical quantum-mechanical MNDO, AM1, and PM3 methods and ab initio STO6-31G basis calculations are used to find geometrically optimized structures of the basic graphyne layers, their structural parameters, and energies of their sublimation.

For identical metals and pulse parameters, the type of spallation is determined by film thickness d  f . An important gauge is metal heating depth d  T  at the two-temperature stage, at which electron temperature is higher than ion temperature. We compare cases with d  f  < d  T  (thin film) and d  f  ≫ d  T  (bulk target). Radius R  L  of the spot of heating by an optical laser is the next (after d  f ) important geometrical parameter. The morphology of film bulging in cases where d  f  < d  T  on the substrate (blistering) changes upon a change in radius R  L  in the range from diffraction limit R  L  ∼ λ to high values of R  L  ≫ λ, where λ ∼ 1 μm is the wavelength of optical laser radiation. When d  f  < d  T , R  L  ∼ λ, and F abs > F m, gold film deposited on the glass target acquires a cupola-shaped blister with a miniature frozen nanojet in the form of a tip on the circular top of the cupola (F abs and F m are the absorbed energy and the melting threshold of the film per unit surface area of the film).

We construct an f(T) model by following the correspondence scheme incorporating a recently developed pilgrim dark energy model and taking the Hubble horizon as the IR cutoff. We use constructed model to discuss the evolution trajectories of the equation-of-state parameter, the ω T -ω′ T  phase plane, and state-finder parameters in the evolving universe. It is found that the equation-of-state parameter gives a phantom era of the accelerated universe for some particular range of the pilgrim parameter. The ω T -ω′ T  plane represents freezing regions only for an interacting framework, while the ΛCDM limit is attained in the state-finder plane. We also investigate the first and second laws of thermodynamics assuming equal temperatures at and inside the horizon in this scenario. Due to the violation of the first law of thermodynamics in f(T) gravity, we explore the behavior of the entropy production term. The validity of a generalized second law of thermodynamics depends on the present-day value of the Hubble parameter.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24546419@JETP
2014@Старков А С|Старков И А|@Multicaloric effect solid New aspects@15@The multicaloric effect that is the result of interaction between various caloric effects has been studied theoretically. The effects attributable to the pairwise interactions of fields (piezomagnetocaloric, piezoelectrocaloric, and magnetoelectrocaloric effects) have been added to the previously known electrocaloric, magnetocaloric, and elastocaloric effects that exist when the electric, magnetic, and elastic fields change. These new effects are shown to be determined by the temperature dependence of the piezomagnetic (magnetostrictive), piezoelectric (electrostrictive), and magnetoelectric coefficients. According to the estimates obtained, the change in entropy in an isothermal process under the magnetoelectrocaloric effect for Cr2O3 is 2–5 mJ kg−1 K−1. The caloric effects caused by the influence of the gradient in one of the fields on other fields are shown to contribute to the multicaloric effect. One of these gradient effects, the flexocaloric one, which consists in a change in temperature and/or entropy when a strain gradient is applied or removed, has been studied in detail as an example. It follows from the derived formulas that the greatest values of this effect should be expected for materials with strong temperature dependences of the flexocaloric coefficient, permittivity, or permeability.

For the former, we adopt the publicly available tool CRPropa and for the latter, we use the code TransportCR, which has been developed by the first author and used in a number of applications, and is made available online with publishing this paper. While the CRPropa code is more universal, the transport equation solver has the advantage of a roughly 100 times higher calculation speed. We conclude that the methods give practically identical results for proton or neutron primaries if some accuracy improvements are introduced to the CRPropa code.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23973288@JETP
2016@Ефрос А Л|Родина А В|@Effect dielectric confinement optical properties colloidal nanostructures@15@We review the effects caused by a large difference in the dielectric constants of a semiconductor and its surrounding in colloidal semiconductor nanostructures (NSs) with various shapes, e.g., nanocrystals, nanorods, and nanoplatelets. The difference increases the electron–hole interaction and consequently the exciton binding energy and its oscillator transition strength. On the other hand, this difference reduces the electric field of a photon penetrating the NS (the phenomenon is called the local field effect) and reduces the photon coupling to an exciton. We show that the polarization properties of the individual colloidal NSs as well as of their randomly oriented ensemble are determined both by the anisotropy of the local field effect and by the symmetry of the exciton states participating in optical transitions. The calculations explain the temperature and time dependences of the degree of linear polarization measured in an ensemble of CdSe nanocrystals.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27157885@JETP

A criterion is proposed for quantifying the hyperchaos, and the position in the three[1]dimensional parameter space where the hyperchaos is largest is determined. In the vicinity of this point, different dynamics are observed including periodicity, quasi-periodicity, chaos, and hyperchaos. Under some conditions, the system has a unique bistable behavior, characterized by a symmetric pair of coexisting limit cycles that undergo period doubling, forming a symmetric pair of strange attractors that merge into a single symmetric chaotic attractor that then becomes hyperchaotic. The system was implemented as an electronic circuit whose behavior confirms the numerical predictions.

Atomic force and electron microscopy studies have demonstrated that the shape and dimension of nanostructures, as well as the threshold parameters of laser radiation for their formation, are determined by the thickness of a modified film (“size effect”) and by the duration of a laser pulse owing to the lateral heat conduction in films (nonlocal energy deposition effect).

We study emission from shungite GQDs for colloidal dispersions in water, carbon tetrachloride, and toluene at both room and low temperatures. As expected, the photoluminescence of the GQD aqueous dispersions is quite similar to that of synthetic GQDs of the rGO origin. The morphological study of shungite dispersions shows a steady trend of GQDs to form fractals and to drastically change the colloid fractal structure caused by the solvent exchange. Spectral study reveals a dual character of the emitting centers: individual GQDs are responsible for the spectra position while the fractal structure of GQD colloids ensures high broadening of the spectra due to structural inhomogeneity, thus causing a peculiar dependence of the photoluminescence spectra on the excitation wavelength. For the first time, photoluminescence spectra of individual GQDs were observed in frozen toluene dispersions, which paves the way for a theoretical treatment of the GQD photonics.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23958615@JETP

The method relies on the approximate integrability of the low-energy effective theory describing the flux tube excitations and is based on the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. The approximate integrability is a consequence of the Lorentz symmetry of QCD. For excited states, the convergence of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz technique is significantly better than that of the traditional perturbative approach. We apply the new technique to the lattice spectra for fundamental flux tubes in gluodynamics in D = 3 + 1 and D = 2 + 1, and to k-strings in gluodynamics in D = 2 + 1.

We discuss the chiral superfluid 3He-A and time reversal invariant phases: superfluid 3He-B, planar and polar phases. The AM zero modes are determined by topology in the bulk and disappear at the quantum phase transition from the topological to nontopological state of the superfluid. The topology demonstrates the interplay of dimensions. In particular, the zero-dimensional Weyl points in chiral superfluids (the Berry phase monopoles in momentum space) give rise to the one-dimensional Fermi arc of AM bound states on the surface and to the one-dimensional flat band of AM modes in the vortex core. The one-dimensional nodal line in the polar phase produces a two-dimensional flat band of AM modes on the surface. The interplay of dimensions also connects the AM states in superfluids with different dimensions. For example, the topological properties of the spectrum of bound states in three-dimensional 3He-B are connected to the properties of the spectrum in the two-dimensional planar phase (thin film).@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24030721@JETP

It has been shown that, in both deformation regimes, a correlated coherent state is rapidly formed with a large correlation coefficient |r| → 1, which corresponds at a low energy of the particle to a very significant (by a factor of 1050–10100 or larger) increase in the transparency of the potential barrier at its interaction with atoms (nuclei) forming the “walls” of the potential well or other atoms located in the same well. The efficiency of the formation of correlated coherent states, as well as |r|, increases with an increase in the deformation interval and with a decrease in the deformation time. The presence of the stochastic force acting on the particle can significantly reduce the maximum |r| value and result in the fast relaxation of correlated coherent states with |r| → 0. The effect of dissipation in real systems is weaker than the action of the stochastic force. It has been shown that the formation of correlated coherent states at the fast expansion of the well can underlie the mechanism of nuclear reactions at a low energy, e.g., in microcracks developing in the bulk of metal hydrides loaded with hydrogen or deuterium, as well as in a low-pressure plasma in a variable magnetic field in which the motion of ions is similar to a harmonic oscillator with a variable frequency.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=22063899@JETP

The story begins from the scattering theory in quantum mechanics where the spectrum reshuffling can be related to permutations of S-matrices. In nontrivial situations, starting from spin chains and matrix models, the S-matrices are operatorvalued and their algebra is described in terms of R- and mixing (Racah) U-matrices. Then the Kontsevich-Soibelman (KS) invariants are nothing but the standard knot invariants made out of these data within the Reshetikhin-Turaev-Witten approach. The R and Racah matrices acquire a relatively universal form in the semiclassical limit, where the basic reshufflings with the change of moduli are those of the Stokes line. Natural from this standpoint are matrices provided by the modular transformations of conformal blocks (with the usual identification R = T and U = S), and in the simplest case of the first degenerate field (2, 1), when the conformal blocks satisfy a second-order Shrödinger-like equation, the invariants coincide with the Jones (N = 2) invariants of the associated knots. Another possibility to construct knot invariants is to realize the cluster coordinates associated with reshufflings of the Stokes lines immediately in terms of check-operators acting on solutions of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. Then the R-matrices are realized as products of successive mutations in the cluster algebra and are manifestly described in terms of quantum dilogarithms, ultimately leading to the Hikami construction of knot invariants.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24027111@JETP

The Allan variance is studied as a function of the averaging time for a tandem of optically pumped quantum magnetometers (OPQMs), one of which is based on a low-frequency spin oscillator while another is based on a quantum microwave discriminator with a resonance frequency that corresponds to magnetically dependent transitions between HFS sublevels with the extremal value of the magnetic quantum number. It is shown that the compensation of the scalar and vector components of the light shift in OPQMs reduces the Allan variance at averaging times that exceed hundreds of seconds compared to a quantum discriminator based on the magnetically independent 0–0 transition. In this case, the minimal Allan variance in OPQMs at the end resonance is achieved at considerably longer averaging times than in the case of the quantum discriminator that is tuned to the 0–0 transition frequency.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24962950@JETP

The calculated temperature dependences of the thermal conductivity of silicon NWs with diameters above 50 nm agree well with experimental data in the 20–300 K range. The temperatures of transitions from the boundary-scattering to volume-relaxation mechanisms are determined. Variation of the thermal conductivity anisotropy depending on temperature is analyzed. The free paths of phonons with various polarizations in the boundary scattering regime in silicon NWs significantly differ and depend to a considerable degree on the phonon focusing. The free paths reach maxima in the directions of phonon focusing and exceed values for other oscillatory modes. However, in the isotropic medium model, the phonon free paths for various polarizations coincide and are fully determined by the geometric parameters of NWs.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=21870490@JETP

Detailed analysis of the data on diffraction of neutrons and X-rays, as well as the results of atomic dynamics simulation, lead to some conclusions about the structure. In particular, for preset conditions, gallium is in the equilibrium liquid phase showing no features of any stable local crystalline clusters. The pronounced asymmetry of the principle peak of the static structure factor and the characteristic “shoulder” in its right-hand part appearing at temperatures close to the melting point, which are clearly observed in the diffraction data, are due to the fact that the arrangement of the nearest neighbors of an arbitrary atom in the system is estimated statistically from the range of correlation length values and not by a single value as in the case of simple liquids. Compactly located dimers with a very short bond make a significant contribution to the statistics of nearest neighbors. The temperature dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient calculated from atomic dynamics simulation agrees well with the results obtained from experimental spectra of the incoherent scattering function. Interpolation of the temperature dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient on a logarithmic scale reveals two linear regions with a transition temperature of about 600 K. The spectra of the dynamic structure factor and spectral densities of the local current calculated by simulating the atomic dynamics indicate the existence of acoustic vibrations with longitudinal and transverse polarizations in liquid gallium, which is confirmed by experimental data on inelastic scattering of neutrons and X-rays. It is found that the vibrational density of states is completely reproduced by the generalized Debye model, which makes it possible to decompose the total vibrational motion into individual contributions associated with the formation of acoustic waves with longitudinal and transverse polarizations. Comparison of the heights of the low-frequency component and of the high-frequency peak in the spectral density of vibrational states also indicates a temperature of T ≈ 600 K, at which the diffusion type of one-particle dynamics changes to the vibrational type upon a decrease in temperature. It is demonstrated that the modified Einstein–Stokes relation can be derived using the generalized Debye model.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26924092@JETP

The parameters of the target were selected so as to provide effective acceleration of the shell toward the center, which was sufficient for the onset of ignition under conditions of increased hydrodynamic stability of the ablator acceleration and compression. The aspect ratio of the inner deuterium-tritium layer of the shell does not exceed 15, provided that a major part (above 75%) of the outer layer (plastic ablator) is evaporated by the instant of maximum compression. The investigation is based on two series of numerical calculations that were performed using one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic codes. The first 1D code was used to calculate the absorption of the profiled laser-radiation pulse (including calculation of the total absorption coefficient with allowance for the inverse bremsstrahlung and resonance mechanisms) and the spatial distribution of target heating for a real geometry of irradiation using 192 laser beams in a scheme of focusing with a cubo-octahedral symmetry.

We will also show that the initial right-handed electron asymmetry ξ eR (η0) used in our leptogenesis model as a free parameter cannot take too large values, ξ eR (η0) = 10−4, because this leads to a negative BAU by the EWPT time. In contrast, a sufficiently small initial right-handed electron asymmetry, ξ eR (η0), provides its further growth and the corresponding BAU growth from zero to some positive value, including the observed B obs = 10−10.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26916727@JETP

It is shown from an analysis of the force of interaction based on the Maxwell stress tensor that two macroparticles with identical charges in the Poisson–Boltzmann model always repel each other both in isothermal and nonisothermal plasmas. At distances between macroparticles for which the Boltzmann exponents can be linearized, the interaction between macroparticles is completely described by the Debye–Hückel model. The correction to free energy due to the electrostatic interaction in the system of two macroparticles is determined by integrating the correction to the internal energy and by direct calculation of the correction for entropy. It is shown that the free energy coincides with the Yukawa potential. The coincidence of the interaction energy obtained by integrating the force of interaction with the free energy leads to the conclusion about the potential nature of the force of interaction between two macroparticles in an equilibrium plasma. The effect of the outer boundary on the electrostatic interaction force is analyzed; it is shown that the type of interaction depends on the choice of the boundary conditions at the outer boundary. It is also shown that the accumulation of space charge near the outer boundary can lead to the attraction of similarly charged particles at distances comparable with the radius of the outer boundary.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26924153@JETP

The rates of nonradiative and radiative processes are calculated depending on the spatial and spectral separation between the donor and acceptor states and for different donor and acceptor lifetimes for typical parameters of semiconductor quantum dots. We find that the donor lifetime can be significantly modified only due to the nonradiative Förster energy transfer process at donor–acceptor separations of approximately 10 nm (depending on the acceptor radiative lifetime) and for the energy detuning not larger than 1–2 meV. The efficiency of the nonradiative Förster energy transfer process under these conditions is close to unity and decreases rapidly with an increase in the donor–acceptor distance or energy detuning. At large donor–acceptor separations greater than 40 nm, the radiative corrections to the donor lifetime are comparable with nonradiative ones but are relatively weak.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27158013@JETP

Such an extension is based on a special relation between functional determinants of the operators acting in the bulk and on its boundary, provided that the boundary operator represents the inverse propagators of the theory induced on the boundary by the Dirichlet boundary value problem in the bulk spacetime. This relation holds for operators of a general spin-tensor structure on generic manifolds with boundaries irrespective of their background geometry and conformal invariance, and it apparently underlies numerous O(N 0) tests of the AdS/CFT correspondence, based on direct calculation of the bulk and boundary partition functions, Casimir energies, and conformal anomalies. The generalized holographic duality is discussed within the concept of the “double-trace” deformation of the boundary theory, which is responsible in the case of large-N CFT coupled to the tower of higher-spin gauge fields for the renormalization group flow between infrared and ultraviolet fixed points.

It is shown that the equations of motion derived in the small interface angle approximation (gravity and capillary forces are neglected) admit exact solutions in the implicit form. The analysis of these solutions shows that, in the general case, weak root singularities are formed on the interface in a finite time for which the curvature becomes infinite, while the slope angles remain small. For Atwood numbers close to unity in absolute values, the surface curvature has a definite sign correlated with the boundary deformation directed towards the light fluid. For the fluids with comparable densities, the curvature changes its sign in a singular point.

A wide range of attractive potentials U is studied, from the weak coupling region, where both the instability of the normal phase and superconductivity are well described by the BCS model, to the strong-coupling region, where the superconducting transition is due to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of compact Cooper pairs, formed at temperatures much higher than the superconducting transition temperature. We study two typical models of the conduction band with semi-elliptic and flat densities of states, respectively appropriate for three-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. For the semi-elliptic density of states, the disorder influence on all single-particle properties (e.g., density of states) is universal for an arbitrary strength of electronic correlations and disorder and is due to only the general disorder widening of the conduction band. In the case of a flat density of states, universality is absent in the general case, but still the disorder influence is mainly due to band widening, and the universal behavior is restored for large enough disorder. Using the combination of DMFT+Σ and Nozieres-Schmitt-Rink approximations, we study the disorder influence on the superconducting transition temperature T  c  for a range of characteristic values of U and disorder, including the BCS-BEC crossover region and the limit of strong-coupling. Disorder can either suppress T  c  (in the weak-coupling region) or significantly increase T  c  (in the strong-coupling region).

The analytic study is facilitated by the choice of the problem parameters related to the dielectric properties of the studied structures. The chosen models allow eliminating polarization mixing at the external surfaces of the studied structures. The dispersion equations determining the relation of the defect mode (DM) frequency to the dielectric characteristics of an isotropic, birefringent and absorbing (amplifying) defect layer and its thickness are obtained. Analytic expressions for the transmission and reflection coefficients of the defect mode structure (DMS) (photonic liquid crystal-active defect layer-photonic liquid crystal) are presented and analyzed. The effect of anomalously strong light absorption at the defect mode frequency for an absorbing defect layer is discussed. It is shown that in a distributed feed-back lasing at the DMS with an amplifying defect layer, adjusting the lasing frequency to the DM frequency results in a significant decrease in the lasing threshold and the threshold gain decreases as the defect layer thickness increases. It is found that, generally speaking, the layer birefringence and dielectric jumps at the interfaces of the defect layer and photonic liquid crystal reduce the DM lifetime in comparison with the DMS with an isotropic defect layer without dielectric jumps at the interfaces. Correspondingly, generally speaking, the effect of anomalously strong light absorption at the defect mode frequency and the decrease in the lasing threshold are not so pronounced as in the case of the DMS with an isotropic defect layer without dielectric jumps at the interfaces.

It is shown that, despite the presence of an electron barrier in the Si0.905Ge0.095 layer, a spatially indirect biexciton is the most favorable energy state of the electron–hole system at low temperatures. This biexciton is characterized by a lifetime of 1100 ns and a binding energy of 2.0–2.5 meV and consists of two holes localized in the SiGe layer and two electrons mainly localized in silicon. The formation of biexcitons is shown to cause low-temperature (5 K) luminescence spectra over a wide excitation density range and to suppress the formation of an exciton gas, in which quantum statistics effects are significant. The Bose statistics can only be experimentally observed for a biexciton gas at a temperature of 1 K or below because of the high degree of degeneracy of biexciton states (28) and a comparatively large effective mass (about 1.3m  e ). The heat energy at such temperatures is much lower than the measured energy of localization at potential fluctuations (about 1 meV).

Special attention is paid to the “third case,” that of neighboring octahedra with a common face (three common oxygens), which has largely been disregarded until now, although there are many real systems with this geometry.

It is established that the structural transformation of orthorhombic Cmmm graphite to 2H polytype of diamond must take place at a pressure of 61 GPa, while the formation of lonsdaleite from hexagonal P6/mmm graphite must take place at 56 GPa. The minimum potential barrier height separating the 2H polytype state from graphite is only 0.003 eV/atom smaller than that for the cubic diamond. The high potential barrier is indicative of the possibility of stable existence of the hexagonal diamond under normal conditions. In this work, we have also analyzed the X-ray diffraction and electron-microscopic data available for nanodiamonds found in meteorite impact craters in search for the presence of hexagonal diamond. Results of this analysis showed that pure 3C and 2H polytypes are not contained in the carbon materials of impact origin, the structure of nanocrystals found representing diamonds with randomly packed layers. The term “lonsdaleite,” used to denote carbon materials found in meteorite impact craters and diamond crystals with 2H polytype structure, is rather ambiguous, since no pure hexagonal diamond has been identified in carbon phases found at meteorite fall sites.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29483290@JETP

The possibility of determining the physical characteristics of a rapidly flying dust cloud, including the microparticle velocities, the microparticle sizes, and the areal density of the dust cloud, is shown. A compact stand for performing experiments on shock-wave loading of metallic samples is described. Shock-wave loading is performed by a 100-µm-thick tantalum flyer plate accelerated to a velocity of 2.8 km/s. As the samples, lead plates having various thicknesses and the same surface roughness are used. At a shock-wave pressure of 31.5 GPa, the destruction products are solid microparticles about 50 µm in size. At a pressure of 42 and 88 GPa, a liquid-drop dust cloud with a particle size of 10–15 µm is formed. To interpret the spectral data on the optoheterodyne Doppler measurements of the expansion of the surface destruction products (spalled fragments, dust microparticles), a transport equation for the function of mutual coherence of a multiply scattered field is used. The Doppler spectra of a backscattered signal are calculated with the model developed for the dust cloud that appears when a shock wave reaches the sample surface at the parameters that are typical of an experimental situation. Qualitative changes are found in the spectra, depending on the optical thickness of the dust cloud.

As the level of substitution increases, the unit cell parameters are shown to decrease monotonically. The temperature (300 K ≤ T ≤ 750 K, H = 8.6 kOe) and field (T = 300 K,–20 kOe ≤ H ≤ 20 kOe) dependences of the saturation magnetization of these solid solutions are studied with a vibrating-sample magnetometer. The concentration dependences of the Curie temperature T C, the specific spontaneous magnetization, and the coercive force are plotted. The magnetic parameters are found to decrease with increasing substitution. The microwave properties of the solid solutions are analyzed in an external magnetic field (0 ≤ H ≤ 4 kOe). As the cation Ga3+ concentration increases from x = 0.1 to 0.6, the natural ferromagnetic resonance (NFMR) frequency decreases; as the concentration increases further to x = 1.2, this frequency again increases. As the cation Ga3+ concentration increases, the NFMR line width increases, which indicates a widening of the frequency range where electromagnetic radiation is intensely absorbed. Here, the resonance curve peak amplitude changes insignificantly. The shift of the NFMR frequency in an applied magnetic field is more pronounced for samples with low cation Ga3+ concentrations.

To produce oxygen vacancies, hafnium oxide was enriched in surplus metal during synthesis. To reduce the oxygen concentration, the film was annealed in oxygen. A qualitative control of the oxygen concentration was carried out by the refractive index. In the initial, almost stoichiometric films we observed a 2.7-eV band in cathodoluminescence. Annealing in oxygen results in a considerable increase in its intensity, as well as in the appearance of new bands at 1.87, 2.14, 3.40, and 3.6 eV. The observed emission bands are supposed to be due to single oxygen vacancies and polyvacancies in hafnium oxide. The luminescence increase under annealing in an oxygen atmosphere may be a result of the emission quenching effect.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24041846@JETP

The measurements were performed for perpendicular and parallel orientations of the magnetic field with respect to the c axis of the crystal, and the detailed angle dependence of the spectra on the magnetic field direction in the ab plane was studied. The shape of the spectra can be well described in the model of spiral spin structure proposed by recent neutron diffraction experiments. When the field is rotated perpendicular to the crystal c axis, we observed, directly for the first time, a remarkable reorientation of the spin plane simultaneous with rotation of the incommensurate wavevector, by quantitatively deducing the conversion of the energetically less favorable domain to a more favorable one. At high enough fields parallel to the c axis, the data are consistent with either a field-induced commensurate spiral magnetic structure or an incommensurate spiral magnetic structure with a disorder in the c direction, suggesting that high fields may have influence on interplanar ordering.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24048910@JETP

The purpose of the investigation is to determine the characterization of the coating in terms of the sticking probability and sticking time of Rb on the two types of coating of high and medium viscosities. We report the measurement of the sticking probability of a Rb atom to the coating equal to 4.3 × 10−5, which corresponds to the number of bounces 2.3 × 104 at room temperature. These parameters are the same for the two kinds of PDMS used. We find that at room temperature, the respective sticking times for high-viscosity and medium-viscosity PDMS are 22 ± 3 μs and 49 ± 6 μs. These sticking times are about million times larger than the sticking time derived from the surface Rb atom adsorption energy and temperature of the coating. A tentative explanation of this surprising result is proposed based on the bulk diffusion of the atoms that collide with the surface and penetrate inside the coating.

The initial experiments based on the coexistence of a normal phase and a superconducting phase in the intermediate state led to the concept itself. It was followed by a focus on geometrically inhomogeneous systems like point contacts, which provided a very clear manifestation of the energy and direction dependence of the Andreev reflection process. The point contacts have recently evolved towards the atomic scale owing to the use of mechanical break-junctions, revealing a very detailed dependence of Andreev reflection on the macroscopic phase of the superconducting state. In present-day research, the superconducting in homogeneity is constructed by clean room technology and combines superconducting materials, for example, with low-dimensional materials and topological insulators. Alternatively, the superconductor is combined with nano-objects, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, or semiconducting nanowires.

Holographic thermalization means a black hole formation, in fact, a trapped surface formation. As the vacuum confining background, we considered the well-know bottom-up AdS/QCD model that provides the Cornell potential and reproduces the QCD β-function. We perturb the vacuum background by colliding domain shock waves that are assumed to be holographically dual to heavy ions collisions. Our main physical assumption is that we can make a restriction on the time of trapped surface formation, which results in a natural limitation on the size of the domain where the trapped surface is produced. This limits the intermediate domain where the main part of the entropy is produced. In this domain, we can use an intermediate vacuum background as an approximation to the full confining background. We find that the dependence of the multiplicity on energy for the intermediate background has an asymptotic expansion whose first term depends on energy as E 1/3, which is very similar to the experimental dependence of particle multiplicities on the colliding ion energy obtained from the RHIC and LHC. However, this first term, at the energies where the approximation of the confining metric by the intermediate background works, does not saturate the exact answer, and we have to take the nonleading terms into account.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24027291@JETP

A microtron with an energy of particles of 7.4 MeV has been used as a source of electrons. The beam of particles incident on a target at small angles is split into particles reflected from the foil, which constitute a reflected beam, and particles crossing the foil, which constitute a refracted beam. The effect of the material and thickness of the foil, as well as the angle between the initial trajectory of the beam and the plane of the target, on the direction of motion and the angular divergence of the beam crossing the foil and the beam reflected from the foil has been analyzed.

The normal mode analysis is used to obtain a linear dispersion relation illustrating the dependence of the wave damping rate on the carrier wave number, the dust viscosity coefficient, the ratio of the ion temperature to the electron temperatures, and the nonthermal parameter. The plasma system is analyzed nonlinearly via the reductive perturbation method that gives the KdV-Burgers equation. Some interesting physical solutions are obtained to study the nonlinear waves. These solutions are related to soliton, a combination between a shock and a soliton, and monotonic and oscillatory shock waves. Their behaviors are illustrated and shown graphically. The characteristics of the DA solitary and shock waves are significantly modified by the presence of nonthermal (fast) ions, the ratio of the ion temperature to the electron temperature, and the dust kinematic viscosity. The topology of the phase portrait and the potential diagram of the KdV-Burgers equation is illustrated, whose advantage is the ability to predict different classes of traveling wave solutions according to different phase orbits. The energy of the soliton wave and the electric field are calculated. The results in this paper can be generalized to analyze the nature of plasma waves in both space and laboratory plasma systems.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26858344@JETP

The acoustic relaxation of the excited surface layer indicates (according to reported data) a characteristic depth of 150 nm of the introduction of the laser radiation energy, which is related to direct linear laser radiation absorption in the photoexcited material due to a decrease in the energy bandgap. The surface temperature, which is probed at a time delay of about 100 ps from the reflection thermomodulation of probe radiation and the integrated continuous thermal emission from the surface, increases with the laser fluence and, thus, favors a nonlinear increase in the fluorescence of sublimated silicon atoms. The surface temperature estimated near the picosecond melting threshold demonstrates a substantial (20%) overheating of the material with respect to the equilibrium melting temperature. Above the melting threshold, the delay of formation of the material melt decreases rapidly (from several tens of picoseconds to several fractions of a picosecond) when the laser fluence and, correspondingly, the surface temperature increase. In the times of acoustic relaxation of the absorbing layer and even later, the time modulation of the optical reflectivity of the material demonstrates acoustic reverberations with an increasing period, which are related to the formation of melt nuclei in the material.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26924279@JETP

The peculiarities of the reflection spectra of this system are investigated and it is shown that the reflection spectra of the stacks of CLC layers of these two types differ from each other. Besides, in contrast to the single CLC layer case, these systems have multiple photonic band gaps. There are two types of such gaps: those selective with respect to polarization of the incident light and nonselective ones. It is shown that the system eigenpolarizations mainly coincide with the quasi-orthogonal, quasi-circular polarizations for normally incident light, except the regions of diffraction reflection selective with respect to the polarization of incident light. The influence of the CLC sublayer thick-nesses, the incidence angle, the local dielectric (magnetic) anisotropy of the CLC layers, and the refractive indices and thicknesses of the isotropic media layers on the reflection spectra and other optical characteristics of the system is investigated.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24547652@JETP

These three types of (CF3I) n  clusters are shown to have different stabilities with respect to fragmentation by both ultraviolet and infrared radiations and completely different dependences of the fragmentation probability on the energy of ultraviolet and infrared radiations. When exposed to ultraviolet radiation, the free (CF3I) n  clusters fragment at comparatively low fluences (Φ UV  ≤ 0.15 J cm−2) and the weakest energy dependence of the fragmentation probability is observed for them. A stronger energy dependence of the fragmentation probability is observed for the (CF3I) n  clusters localized inside (Xe) m  clusters, and the strongest dependence is observed for the (CF3I) n  clusters located on the surface of (Xe) m  clusters. When the clusters are exposed to infrared radiation, the homogeneous (CF3I) n  clusters efficiently fragment at low fluences (Φ IR  ≤ 25 mJ cm−2), higher fluences (Φ IR  ≈ 75 mJ cm−2) are needed for the fragmentation of the (CF3I) n  localized inside (Xe) m  clusters, and even higher fluences (Φ IR  ≈ 150 mJ cm−2) are needed for the fragmentation of the (CF3I) n  clusters located on the surface of (Xe) m  clusters. It has been established that small (CF3I) n  clusters located on the surface of (Xe) m  clusters do not fragment up to fluences Φ IR  ≈ 250 mJ cm−2.

We consider a homogeneous structure (liquid) and a perfect periodic crystal, which are constructed from the one-mode approximation of the phase field crystal model. A diagram of 2D structures is constructed from the analytic solutions of the model using atomic density functionals. The diagram predicts equilibrium atomic configurations for transitions from the metastable state and includes the domains of existence of homogeneous, triangular, and striped structures corresponding to a liquid, a body-centered cubic crystal, and a longitudinal cross section of cylindrical tubes. The method developed here is employed for constructing the diagram for the homogeneous liquid phase and the body-centered iron lattice. The expression for the free energy is derived analytically from density functional theory. The specific features of approximating the phase field crystal model are compared with the approximations and conclusions of the weak crystallization and 2D melting theories.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26983842@JETP

In this approach, the symmetry of compression and ignition of thermonuclear fuel play the major role. We report on the results of theoretical investigation of compression and burning of spherical direct-drive targets in the conditions of spatial nonuniformity of heating associated with a shift of the target from the beam center of focusing and possible laser radiation energy disbalance in the beams. The investigation involves numerous calculations based on a complex of 1D and 2D codes RAPID, SEND (for determining the target illumination and the dynamics of absorption), DIANA, and NUT (1D and multidimensional hydrodynamics of compression and burning of targets). The target under investigation had the form of a two-layer shell (ablator made of inertial material CH and DT ice) filled with DT gas. We have determined the range of admissible variation of compression and combustion parameters of the target depending on the variation of the spatial nonuniformity of its heating by a multibeam laser system. It has been shown that low-mode (long-wavelength) perturbations deteriorate the characteristics of the central region due to less effective conversion of the kinetic energy of the target shell into the internal energy of the center. Local initiation of burning is also observed in off-center regions of the target in the case of substantial asymmetry of irradiation. In this case, burning is not spread over the entire volume of the DT fuel as a rule, which considerably reduces the thermonuclear yield as compared to that in the case of spherical symmetry and central ignition.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29481117@JETP

A spontaneous transition from a collinear ferrimagnetic single-axis phase to a conical structure is detected in all compositions, the transition temperature increases with the Sc concentration, and the Curie temperature decreases with increasing Sc concentration. The conical magnetic structures exhibit an electric polarization (more than 40 μC/m2 at T = 4 K) induced by a magnetic field. The conditions of appearance of the polarization indicate that it is caused by the inverse Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction. The dependences of the polarization on the value and the orientation of a magnetic field are investigated, and the possibilities of controlling the chirality of a conical structure, which determines the sign of polarization, are demonstrated.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31048626@JETP

Based on the obtained solution of the Dirac equation and the known solution of the “onedimensional” Schrödinger equation by ordinary QED methods extrapolated to the {0; 3} subspace, the probability of photon emission by a “one-dimensional” hydrogen-like atom is calculated, which, for example, for the Lyman-alpha line differs almost twice from the probability in the “three-dimensional” case. Similarly, despite the coincidence of nonrelativistic energy levels, the calculated relativistic corrections of the order of (Zα)4 substantially differ from corrections in the absence of a magnetic field. A conclusion is made that, by analyzing the hydrogen emission spectrum and emission spectra at all, we can judge in principle about the presence or absence of superstrong magnetic fields in the vicinity of magnetars (neutron stars and probably brown dwarfs). Possible prospects of applying the proposed method for calculations of multielectron atoms are pointed out and the possibility of a more reliable determination of the presence of superstrong magnetic fields in magnetars by this method is considered.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31058677@JETP

In this paper, we study the potential and electron density depth profiles in surface accumulation layers in crystals with a large and nonlinear dielectric response such as SrTiO3 (STO) in the cases of planar, spherical, and cylindrical geometries. The electron gas can be created by applying an induction D 0 to the STO surface. We describe the lattice dielectric response of STO using the Landau–Ginzburg free energy expansion and employ the Thomas–Fermi (TF) approximation for the electron gas. For the planar geometry, we arrive at the electron density profile n(x) ∝ (x + d)–12/7, where d ∝ D  0 –12/7 . We extend our results to overlapping electron gases in GTO/STO/GTO heterojunctions and electron gases created by spill-out from NSTO (heavily n-type doped STO) layers into STO. Generalization of our approach to a spherical donor cluster creating a big TF atom with electrons in STO brings us to the problem of supercharged nuclei. It is known that for an atom with a nuclear charge Ze where Z > 170, electrons collapse onto the nucleus, resulting in a net charge Zn < Z. Here, instead of relativistic physics, the collapse is caused by the nonlinear dielectric response. Electrons collapse into the charged spherical donor cluster with radius R when its total charge number Z exceeds the critical value Z  c  ≈ R/a, where a is the lattice constant. The net charge e Z  n  grows with Z until Z exceeds Z* ≈ (R/a)9/7. After this point, the charge number of the compact core Z  n  remains ≈ Z*, with the rest Z* electrons forming a sparse TF atom with it. We extend our studies of collapse to the case of long cylindrical clusters as well.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27159877@JETP

By varying the pump-pulse duration and keeping the probe duration constant, it was shown that the amplitude of coherent phonons of both symmetries exponentially decreases with increasing pulse width. It was found that the amplitude decay rate for the fully symmetric phonons with larger frequency is greater than that of the doubly degenerate phonons, whereas the frequency and lifetime for coherent phonons of both symmetries do not depend on the pump-pulse duration.

We calculate the cohesion binding energy for the exciton gas and, using it, derive the equations of state, critical parameters, and binodal. The computational method is analogous to that used by us earlier [5] for predicting the vapor-liquid (insulator-metal) phase transition in atomic (hypothetical, free of molecules) hydrogen and alkali metal vapors.

The phonon contribution to the nodal anomalous electron Green’s function (GF) is considered. Pairing within the total width of the electron band, and not only in a narrow layer at the Fermi surface, is taken into account. The calculated frequency and temperature dependences, as well as the dependence on the doping level of the complex renormalization ReZ, ImZ of the mass, complex renormalization Reχ(ω), Imχ(ω) of the chemical potential, and DOS N(ε) renormalized due to the EP interaction are used to calculate the electron nodal anomalous GF. It is found that the effect of suppressing the high-frequency contribution to the Eliashberg equations derived anew for the EP system with a finite width of the electron band is a decisive factor for the manifestation of the effect of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). It is shown that in the vicinity of the optimal hole-type doping level in cuprates, the high value of T  c  is reproduced by the spectral function of the electron–phonon interaction, which is obtained from tunneling experiments. Upon an increase in the doping level, leading to an increase in the degree of electron–hole nonequivalence, the new logarithmic term appearing in the equations for T  c  has a tendency to increase T  c , while intensification of damping of charge carriers (especially suppression of the cutoff factor) leads to a decrease in T  c .@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24950172@JETP

It has been shown that such a modulation in the absence of a stochastic force acting on a particle results in the fast formation of correlated coherent states and in an increase in the correlation coefficient and transparency of the potential barrier to the limiting values |r(t)|max → 1 and D → 1. The presence of the stochastic force significantly affects the evolution of correlated coherent states, decreasing the rate of an increase in the correlation coefficient |r(t)|max (at Ω ≤ 10−4ω0) and limiting it at the level |r(∞)|max < 1 (at Ω = (0.001–0.1)ω0); |r(∞)|max increases with a decrease in the frequency of modulation and decreases with an increase in the intensity of the stochastic force. It has been shown that, at a realistic relation between the parameters, low-frequency modulation can ensure such |r|max value that the transparency of the potential barrier for low-energy particles increases by a factor of 1050–10100 or larger. The mechanism of the formation of correlated coherent states for charged particles in a gas or a low-pressure plasma placed in a low-frequency magnetic field has been considered.

The peak on the dependence of the critical current density on the interlayer material thickness corresponds to the coherence length, which is in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions for a system with spit-triplet superconducting correlations.

An increase in pressure up to ∼2 GPa leads to changes in the Raman spectra, which are manifested by splitting of the intramolecular H  g (1)-H  g (8) phonon modes and by softening of the A  g (2) mode of the C60 molecule. A further increase in pressure up to 17 GPa does not induce significant new changes to the Raman spectra, while a decrease is accompanied by the reverse transformation at a pressure of about 2 GPa. The pressure dependence of the lattice parameters also exhibits a reversible feature at 2 GPa related to a jumplike decrease in compressibility. All these data are indicative of a phase transition in the vicinity of 2 GPa related to the formation of covalent bonds between C60 molecules and, probably, the appearance of C120 dimers in fullerene layers. It was also found that, in the pressure interval from 2 to 6.3 GPa, the Raman spectra of complexes exhibit photoinduced transformations under prolonged exposure to laser radiation with a wavelength of λ = 532 nm and power density up to 5000 W/cm2. These changes are manifested by splitting and softening of the A  g (2) mode and resemble analogous changes accompanying the photopolymerization of C60 fullerene. The intensity of new bands exhibits exponential growth with increasing exposure time. The photopolymer yield depends on both the laser radiation power and external pressure.

Our simplest statistical approximation, called the “kinetic mean-field approximation” (KMFA), corresponds to using the mean-field approximation for statistical averages and the pair-cluster approximation (PCA) for calculations of thermodynamic parameters; for dilute alloys, the KMFA is exact. To describe vacancy correlation effects at any concentrations, we develop both the nearest-neighbor-jump approximation and the second-shell-jump approximation. We also describe methods to take into account fluctuations in statistical averages using the PCA, and to describe non-pairwise vacancy-solute correlations using the triple vacancy-solute correlation model. For each of approximations and methods developed, we derive expressions for the Onsager coefficients at any composition of an alloy. For binary alloys, we also present expressions for the diffusion coefficients. The results obtained can provide a basis for microscopic calculations of diffusion coefficients at any composition of an alloy.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24002210@JETP

We consider correlation functions of all orders for electrons in the QDs by decoupling higher-order correlations between localized and band electrons in the reservoir. We analyze different initial charge configurations and consider Coulomb correlations between localized electrons both within the dots and between the different dots. We reveal the presence of a dynamical charge trapping effect in the first QD in the situation where both dots are occupied at the initial instant.

Spin-charge correlations are manifested in the existence of two channels. The first channel is due to the p-d exchange coupling of spins of the oxygen and copper holes. The second channel appears as a result of spin-correlated hoppings, when the motion of holes over oxygen ions is accompanied by spin-flip processes (i.e., simultaneous changes in the spin projections of an oxygen hole and a copper ion). It is established as a result of self-consistent calculations that the allowance for the concentration dependence of spin correlators and multicenter spin-charge correlators appearing in the dispersion equation ensures a decrease in the energy of the system and considerably affects the evolution of the Fermi surface under hole doping.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23972441@JETP

This study has been performed beyond the approximation of slowly varying amplitudes standard for quasimonochromatic signals. It has been shown that the role of higher lying states is fundamentally important and is not reduced only to correction effects. Previously unknown soliton-like regimes of propagation, as well as the corresponding dynamics of a medium, have been analyzed. Nonlinear refraction processes have been taken into account. Conditions for self-focusing and defocusing of pulses have been revealed. A new type of localized terahertz “bullets” with sharp boundaries at a nonequilibrium initial population of tunneling states has been predicted. The main difference of these bullets from those previously considered in an optical range is that diffraction does not affect the formation of the former. In this case, the focusing effect caused by a tunneling transition is compensated by the defocusing effect of transitions to higher lying states under the conditions of applicability of the geometrical optics approximation.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24001185@JETP

To date, they have been formulated as effective field theories with a cutoff proportional to a positive power of the graviton mass m  g  and much smaller than that of the massless theory (M  P  ≈ 1019 GeV in the case of general relativity). In this paper, we present an ultraviolet completion for massive gravity valid up to a high energy scale independent of the graviton mass. The construction is based on the existence of a preferred time foliation combined with spontaneous condensation of vector fields. The perturbations of these fields are massive and below their mass, the theory reduces to a model of Lorentz violating massive gravity. The latter theory possesses instantaneous modes whose consistent quantization we discuss in detail. We briefly study some modifications to gravitational phenomenology at low-energies.

Based on hydrodynamic similarity criteria, we consider possible supernova-simulating laser targets that will allow one to reproduce the physical processes that take place during the explosion of an astrophysical object, such as the shock propagation through the material, the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities at the boundaries of envelopes with different densities, etc.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24031077@JETP

X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy demonstrate sharp interfaces and epitaxial growth of the LSMO and SRO layers in the heterostructures at an LMO layer thickness of 0–35 nm. SQUID measurements of the magnetic moment of the heterostructures with an LMO layer and the data obtained with reflectometry of polarized neutrons show that the manganite LMO layer is a ferromagnet at a temperature below 150 K and strongly affects the magnetic moment of the heterostructures at low temperatures. The magnetoresistance of the mesostructure created from the heterostructure using lithography and ion etching decreases with increasing LMO layer thickness and weakly depends on the direction of an applied magnetic field. If the LMP layer is absent, a negative magnetoresistance is detected; it is likely to be caused by a negative magnetization of the SRO layer.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24006428@JETP

The electronic structure of graphene is described using the Shubin-Vonsovsky model taking into account the intratomic, interatomic, and interlayer (in the case of bilayer graphene) Coulomb interactions between electrons. The Cooper instability is determined by solving the Bethe-Saltpeter integral equation. The renormalized scattering amplitude is obtained with allowance for the Kohn-Luttinger polarization contributions up to the second order of perturbation theory in the Coulomb interaction. It plays the role of effective interaction in the Bethe-Salpeter integral equation. It is shown that the allowance for the Kohn-Luttinger renormalizations as well as intersite Coulomb interaction noticeably affects the competition between the superconducting phases with the f-wave and d + id-wave symmetries of the order parameter.

It is established that relaxation of the L23 rapidly flows out during the overpressure relief time, following the variation in pressure. At a temperature below that of the dispersion transition (T < T d = 284 K), e.g., at T = 277 K, the degree of filling θ decreases from 1 to 0.8 within 10 s. The degree of filling varies with time according to the power law θ ~ t –α with the exponent α < 0.1 over a period of t ~ 105 s. This process corresponds to slow relaxation of a metastable state of a nonwetting liquid in a porous medium. At times t > 105 s, the metastable state exhibits decay, manifested as the transition to a power dependence of θ(t) with a larger exponent. The relaxation of the metastable state of nonwetting liquid in a disordered porous medium is described in the mean field approximation as a continuous sequence of metastable states with a barrier decreasing upon a decrease in the degree of filling.

The shallow-water magnetohydrodynamic equations have been generalized to the case of a plasma layer in an external vertical magnetic field. We have considered two types of the flow, viz., the flow in an external vertical magnetic field and the flow in the presence of a horizontal magnetic field. Qualitative analysis of the dispersion curves shows the presence of three-wave nonlinear interactions of the magnetic Rossby waves in both cases. In the particular case of zero external magnetic field, the wave dynamics in the layer of a plasma is analogous to the wave dynamics in a neutral fluid.

Unlike other well-known multimode photonic Schrödinger-cat states such as entangled coherent states, the hierarchical superposition states are characterized as two-branch superpositions of tensor products of single-mode Schrödinger-cat states. In addition to analyzing the photon statistics and quasiprobability distributions of prominent examples of these nonclassical states, we consider their usefulness for highprecision quantum metrology of nonlinear optical Hamiltonians and quantify their mode entanglement. We propose two methods for generating hierarchical superpositions in N = 2 coupled microwave cavities, exploiting currently existing quantum optical technology for generating entanglement between spatially separated electromagnetic field modes.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26924133@JETP

Both factors can induce the cholesteric–nematic transition independently; however, the difference in the orienting actions of the magnetic field and the shear flow leads to competition between magnetic and hydrodynamic mechanisms of influence on the cholesteric liquid crystal. We have analyzed different orientations of the magnetic field relative to the direction of the flow in the shear plane. In a number of limiting cases, the analytic dependences are obtained for the pitch of the cholesteric helix deformed by the shear flow. The phase diagrams of the cholesteric–nematic transitions and the pitch of the cholesteric helix are calculated for different values of the magnetic field strength and the angle of orientation, the flow velocity gradient, and the reactive parameter. It is shown that the magnetic field stabilizes the orientation of the director in the shear flow and expands the boundaries of orientability of cholesterics. It has been established that the shear flow shifts the critical magnetic field strength of the transition. It is shown that a sequence of reentrant orientational cholesteric–nematic–cholesteric transitions can be induced by rotating the magnetic field in certain intervals of its strength and shear flow velocity gradients.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31054907@JETP

The main feature of the model is the presence of the electron jelly existing at any density of the atomic component. The number of electrons in the jelly increases under compression. The process of its formation can be called the “cold” ionization, or pressure ionization. The composition of the gas–plasma mixture, including the concentration of atoms and electrons in the jelly, as well as the concentration of free thermally ionized electrons and ions, has been calculated. The conductivity of dense vapors is determined by the sum of the conductivities of thermal electrons (which is calculated using the Frost formula) and jelly electrons (which is calculated by the Regel–Ioffe formula for the minimal metal-type conductivity). The concentration of thermal electrons decreases and the concentration of jelly electrons increases upon compression of the vapor. Accordingly, the conductivity varies from the conductivity of thermal electrons to the conductivity of jelly electrons, continuously passing through the minimum.

Such a correlation can be produced by a broadband parametric source. The interaction leading to scattering of the atom from the nonuniform field occurs in the dispersion limit or in the wing of the absorption line of the atom. Apart from the quantized field, the atom simultaneously interacts with two classical counterpropagating waves with different frequencies, which are acting in the plane perpendicular to the atom’s propagation velocity and to the wavevector of the standing wave. Joint action of the quantized field and two classical waves induces effective two-photon and Raman resonance interaction on the working transition. The effective Hamiltonian of the interaction is derived using the unitary transformation method developed for a moving atom. A strong effect is detected, which makes it possible to distinguish the correlated initial state of the atom and the field in the scattering of atom from the state of independent systems. For all three waves, scattering is not observed when systems with quantum correlation are prepared using a high-intensity parametric source. Conversely, when the atom interacts only with the nonuniform field of the standing wave, scattering is not observed in the case of the initial factorized state.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27587353@JETP

The graphene monolayer synthesized on the Re(0001) surface and then subjected to the intercalation of Pb atoms is studied by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction. The intercalation of Pb atoms under graphene takes place when the substrate is annealed above 500°C. As a result of the intercalation of Pb atoms, graphene becomes quasi-free-standing and a local band gap appears at the Dirac point. The band gap changes with the substrate temperature during the formation of the graphene/Pb/Re(0001) system. The band gap is 0.3 eV at an annealing temperature of 620°C and it increases up to 0.4 eV upon annealing at 830°C. Based on our data, we conclude that the band gap is mainly caused by the hybridization of the graphene π state with the rhenium 5d states located near the Dirac point of the graphene π state.

Using the transmission line and the receiver in the initial ground state we can transfer the coherences to the receiver without interaction between them, although the matrix elements contributing to each particular coherence intertwist in the receiver’s state. Therefore we propose a tool based on the unitary transformation at the receiver side to untwist these elements and thus restore (at least partially) the structure of the sender’s initial density matrix. A communication line with two-qubit sender and receiver is considered as an example of implementation of this technique.

The underlying physical reason lies in temperature-dependent formation enthalpy of the defects, which is controlled by temperature dependence of the elastic moduli. We present an evaluation of the “true” H- and S-values for aluminum, which are derived on the basis of experimental data by taking into account temperature dependence of the formation enthalpy related to temperature dependence of the elastic moduli. The knowledge of the “true” activation parameters is needed for a correct calculation of the defect concentration constituting thus an issue of major importance for different fundamental and application issues of condensed matter physics and chemistry.

The experimental value of K  n  agrees in order of magnitude with the theoretical prediction, while K  s  is several dozen times larger than the theoretical value. The values of T eff in the absence of the field for the structures with copper and hafnium are close to the sample temperature, while the value for aluminum with an iron sublayer is several times greater than this temperature. For the structure with copper at T = 0.08–0.1 K in the magnetic field B|| = 200–300 G oriented in the plane of the sample, the effective temperature T eff increases to 0.4 K, while that in the perpendicular (normal) field B ⊥ ≈ 30 G increases to 0.17 K. In large fields, the Andreev conductance cannot be reliably recognized against the background of single- carrier tunneling current.

Using the self-consistent fluctuating local field approximation, nonlinear equations are derived for autocorrelation functions averaged over the independent random arrangement of spins (magnetic atoms) in a diamagnetic lattice with different spin concentrations. The equations take into account the specificity of the dipole–dipole interaction. First, due to its axial symmetry in a strong static magnetic field, the autocorrelation functions of longitudinal and transverse spin components are described by different equations. Second, the long-range type of the dipole–dipole interaction is taken into account by separating contributions into the local field from distant and near spins. The recurrent equations are obtained for the expansion coefficients of autocorrelation functions in power series in time. From them, the numerical value of the coordinate of the nearest singularity of the autocorrelation function is found on the imaginary time axis, which is equal to the radius of convergence of these expansions. It is shown that in the strong dilution case, the logarithmic concentration dependence of the coordinate of the singularity is observed, which is caused by the presence of a cluster of near spins whose fraction is small but contribution to the modulation frequency is large. As an example a silicon crystal with different 29Si concentrations in magnetic fields directed along three crystallographic axes is considered.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29484864@JETP

It is found that the structure imperfection increases, and the symmetry of a rhombohedrally distorted R3̅c perovskite structure changes into its pseudocubic type during isovalent substitution for Ln = La3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, or Eu3+ when the ionic radius of an A cation decreases. Defect molar formulas are determined for a real perovskite structure, which contains anion and cation vacancies. The decrease in the temperatures of the metal–semiconductor (T ms) and ferromagnet–paramagnet (T C) phase transitions and the increase in electrical resistivity ρ and activation energy E a with increasing serial number of Ln are caused by an increase in the concentration of vacancy point defects, which weaken the double exchange 3d 4(Mn3+)–2p 6(O2–)–3d 3(Mn4+)–V (a)–3d 4(Mn3+). The crystal structure of the compositions with Ln = La contains nanostructured planar clusters, which induce an anomalous magnetic hysteresis at T = 77 K.

However, the measurements of photoluminescence in a wide range of optical excitation densities show that Zeeman splitting weakly depends on the optical pumping (its variation does not exceed 15% of the splitting in a field of 12 T).

A covariant calculation technique is used to derive the expression for the squares of S-matrix elements of these reactions, which is also valid in reference frames in which the medium moves as a single whole along magnetic field lines. Simple analytic expressions obtained for the neutrino and antineutrino emissivities for a moderately degenerate plasma fully characterize the emissivity and absorbability of the studied medium. It is shown that the approximation used here is valid for core collapse supernovae and accretion disks around black holes; beta processes in these objects are predominantly neutrino reactions. The analytic expressions obtained for the emissivities can serve as a good approximation for describing the interaction of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos with the medium of the objects in question and hold for an arbitrary magnetic field strength. Due to their simplicity, these expressions can be included in the magnetohydrodynamic simulation of supernovae and accretion disks to calculate neutrino and antineutrino transport in them. The rates of beta processes and the energy and momentum emitted in them are calculated for an optically transparent matter. It is shown that the macroscopic momentum transferred in the medium increases linearly with the magnetic field strength and can substantially affect the dynamics of supernovae and accretion disks in the regions of a degenerate matter. It is also shown that the rates of beta processes and the energy emission for a magnetic field strength of B ≲ 1015 G typical of supernovae and accretion disks are lower than in the absence of field.

, in the plasma of the early Universe generated both before and after the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is calculated. It is well known that in the Standard Model the leptogenesis before the EWPT, in particular, for neutrinos, owes to the Abelian anomaly in a massless hypercharge field. At the same time, the generation of neutrino asymmetry in the Higgs phase after the EWPT has not been considered previously due to the absence of any quantum anomaly in an external electromagnetic field for such electroneutral particles as neutrinos, in contrast to the Adler anomaly for charged left- and right-handed massless electrons in the same electromagnetic field. Using the Boltzmann equation for neutrinos modified to include the Berry curvature term in momentum space, we establish a violation of the macroscopic neutrino current in the plasma after the EWPT and exactly reproduce the non-conservation of the lepton current in the symmetric phase before the EWPT that owes to the contribution of the triangle anomaly in an external hypercharge field but already without computing the corresponding Feynman diagrams. We apply the new kinetic equation to calculate the neutrino asymmetry by taking into account the Berry curvature and the electroweak interaction with plasma particles in the Higgs phase, including that after the neutrino decoupling in the absence of their collisions in the plasma. We find that this asymmetry is too small for observations. Thus, a difference between the relic neutrino and antineutrino densities, if it exists, must appear already in the symmetric phase of the early Universe before the EWPT."@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31028308@JETP

It has been established that the sites that are most energetically preferred for the adsorption of oxygen are hollow (H) positions on the (001) surface and bridge (B) positions on the (110) and (100) surfaces. Structural and electronic factors that define their energy preference have been discussed. Changes in the atomic and electronic structure of subsurface layers that occur as the oxygen concentration increases to three monolayers have been analyzed. It has been shown that the formation of chemical bonds of oxygen with both components of the alloy leads to the appearance of states that are split-off from the bottoms of their valence bands, which is accompanied by the formation of a forbidden gap at the Fermi level and by a weakening of the Ti–Al metallic bonds in the alloy. On the Al-terminated (001) and (110) surfaces, the oxidation of aluminum dominates over that of titanium. On the whole, the binding energy of oxygen on the low-index surfaces with a mixed termination is higher than that at the aluminum-terminated surface. The calculation of the diffusion of oxygen in the TiAl3 alloy has shown that the lowest barriers correspond to the diffusion between tetrahedral positions in the (001) plane; the diffusion of oxygen in the [001] direction occurs through octahedral and tetrahedral positions. An increase in the concentration of aluminum in the alloy favors a reduction in the height of the energy barriers as compared to the corresponding barriers in the γ-TiAl alloy.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29476114@JETP

A noncanonical Hamilton equation of motion for the macroscopically averaged vorticity has been derived for a smoothly inhomogeneous array of filaments (vortex lattice) taking into account spatial nonuniformity of the equilibrium density of the condensate, which is determined by the trap potential. The minimum of the corresponding Hamiltonian describes the static configuration of the deformed vortex lattice against the preset density background. The condition of minimum can be reduced to a nonlinear second-order partial differential vector equation for which some exact and approximate solutions are obtained. It has been shown that if the condensate density has an anisotropic Gaussian profile, the equation of motion for the averaged vorticity has solutions in the form of a vector exhibiting a nontrivial time dependence, but homogeneous in space. An integral representation has also been obtained for the matrix Green function that determines the nonlocal Hamiltonian of a system of several quantized vortices of an arbitrary shape in a Bose–Einstein condensate with the Gaussian density. In particular, if all filaments are straight and oriented along one of the principal axes of the ellipsoid, we have a finitedimensional reduction that can describe the dynamics of the system of pointlike vortices against an inhomogeneous background. A simple approximate expression is proposed for the 2D Green function with an arbitrary density profile and is compared numerically with the exact result in the Gaussian case. The corresponding approximate equations of motion, describing the long-wavelength dynamics of interacting vortex filaments in condensates with a density depending only on transverse coordinates, have been derived.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31074283@JETP

It was found that small substitution of Co3+ ions by Al3+ ions in the YbRBaCo4–x M x O7 system (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5) leads to a rapid decrease and smearing of ΔE(T)/E 0 anomalies of the Young’s modulus in the region of the structural phase transition, which is accompanied by increasing hysteresis. Pure rare-earth cobaltites RBaCo4O7 (R = Dy–Er, Y) exhibit a correlation between the room-temperature structure distortion and hysteresis on the ΔE(T)/E 0 curve in a temperature interval of 80–280 K. In Zn-substituted cobaltites RBaCoZn3O7, both the hysteresis and ΔE(T)/E 0 anomalies disappear, as do low-temperature sound absorption maxima. This behavior is evidence of the suppression of structural and magnetic phase transitions and the retention of only short-range correlations of the order parameter in Zn-substituted samples.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26992799@JETP

The key feature of the analysis is that exact analytic solutions of the nonlinear field equations are employed to study the mode properties in detail. Based on such a nonperturbative approach, we rigorously prove that the total energy of free nonlinear oscillations in a distributed conservative system, such as that considered in our work, can exactly coincide with the sum of energies of the normal modes of the system.

A sample in the first, normal geometry is fabricated in the form of a sandwich with an α-CuPc film between a transparent SnO2 electrode on a substrate and an upper reflecting Al electrode. In the second case of the planar geometry, the semiconductor is deposited on the substrate with a system of submicron chromium interdigital electrodes. It has been found that the effective photoconductivity in the planar geometry is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that in the normal geometry. In addition to the classical model (without excitons), a simple exciton model has been proposed within which a relation has been obtained between the probability of the formation of electron–hole pairs and the characteristic recombination and dissociation times of excitons. An increase in the photoconductivity in the planar geometry has been explained within the exciton model by an increase in the rate of dissociation of excitons into electron–hole pairs owing to acceptor oxygen molecules, which diffuse more efficiently into the film in the case of the planar geometry where the upper electrode is absent.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26983880@JETP

The elastic forces of the matrix and the magnetic forces acting between granules are comparable in magnitude even under small deformations. As a result, these materials acquire a number of new properties; in particular, their mechanical and/or magnetic characteristics can depend strongly on the polymer matrix filling with magnetic particles and can change under the action of an external magnetic field, pressure, and temperature. To describe the properties of elastomers, we use a model in which the interaction of magnetic granules randomly arranged in space with one another is described in the dipole approximation by the distribution function of dipole fields, while their interaction with the matrix is described phenomenologically. A multitude of deformation, magnetic-field, and temperature effects that are described in this paper and are quite accessible to experimental observation arise within this model.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27094682@JETP

When the pressure in the chamber changes in the range 0–1 atm, the NC thickness is smoothly varied in the range L = 140–1700 nm, which is caused by the pressure-induced deformation of thin garnet windows in the chamber. The pressure dependence has excellent reproducibility even after many hundreds of cycles of letting in of air and its complete pumping out from the chamber. The accuracy of setting required thickness L is much better than in the wedge-gap NCs to be moved mechanically that were used earlier. The processes of Faraday rotation (FR) of a polarization plane, resonance absorption, and fluorescence are studied using the D 1-line narrow-band continuous laser radiation when the thickness changes from L = λ/2 (398 nm) to L = 2λ (1590 nm) at a step λ/2. The FR signal is shown to be maximal at L = λ/2 and 3λ/2 and to have the minimum spectral width (≈60 MHz). At L = λ and 2λ, the FR signal is minimal and has the maximum spectral width (≈200 MHz). The resonance absorption demonstrates the same oscillating behavior; however, the effect in the case of FR is much more pronounced. The oscillating effect is absent for resonance fluorescence: its spectral width and amplitude increase monotonically with L. The detected effects are explained and possible applications are noted.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31088381@JETP

The problem has been solved by the modified Ambartsumyan layer summation method. It has been shown that the given system is nonreciprocal with respect to not only circular, but linear polarizations also. In this case, a new type of nonreciprocity is observed (namely, the relation R(α) ≠ R(–α) holds, where R is the reflection coefficient and α is the angle of incidence). It has been demonstrated that in the case of oblique incidence, there appears a new photonic forbidden band that is not selective relative to the polarization of incident light. We have detected strong dependences of reflectance, absorbance, transmittance nonreciprocity, and other characteristics on the angle between the direction of the external static magnetic field and the normal to the layer boundary.

Studies were performed with a molecular CF3I gas diluted with argon or xenon using a cw CO2 laser. The control of clustering is based on the resonance vibrational excitation of molecules or clusters by the IR laser radiation near the nozzle exit. Depending on the distance from the excitation region to the nozzle cut, the irradiation of the molecular beam either suppresses the clustering of resonantly excited molecules (when the beam is irradiated near the nozzle exit where clustering occurs) or causes the dissociation of small clusters (when the beam is irradiated away from the nozzle where clustering is at the growth stage). The suppression of molecular clustering and the dissociation of clusters in beams were studied by measuring and analyzing the integrated intensities of ion peaks of cluster fragments with a time-of-flight spectrometer. The efficiencies of clustering suppression and cluster dissociation were studied as functions of exciting laser radiation parameters, the beam irradiation geometry, gas parameters over the nozzle, and the nozzle construction. It is shown that the efficiencies of clustering suppression and cluster dissociation strongly depend on the exciting laser radiation intensity, the nozzle construction, and the distance from the irradiation region to the nozzle cut.

Two methods of sample magnetic exposure were used: in a constant field B = 0–0.6 T and in crossed fields in the EPR scheme—the Earth’s field B Earth (50 μT) and a variable pumping field \tilde B( \sim 1 \mu T)\tilde B( \sim 1 \mu T) at frequencies ν ~ 1 MHz. In the experiments in the EPR scheme, the change of the field orientation from \tilde B \bot B_{Earth}\tilde B \bot B_{Earth} to \left. {\tilde B} \right\|B_{Earth}\left. {\tilde B} \right\|B_{Earth} led to almost complete suppression of the effect in the NaCl(Ni) crystals and reduced only slightly (approximately by 20%) the height of the resonance peak of dislocation mean paths in the crystals without Ni, with the amplitude of the mean paths in NaCl(Ni) in the orientation \tilde B \bot B_{Earth}\tilde B \bot B_{Earth} having been appreciably lower than that in NaCl. In contrast, upon exposure to a constant magnetic field, a more intense effect was observed in the crystal with Ni. The threshold pumping field amplitude \tilde B\tilde B, below which the effect is absent under resonance conditions, for the NaCl(Ni) crystals turned out to be a factor of 5 smaller than that for NaCl, while the thresholds of a constant magnetic field coincide for both types of crystals.

The temperature dependences of the Wendt–Abraham parameter and the translation order parameter are used to determine the glass transition temperature in the Zr47Cu46Al7 system, which is found to be T  c  ≈ 750 K. It is found that the bulk amorphous Zr47Cu46Al7 alloy contains localized regions with an ordered atomic structures.

We extend the renormalization group (RG) analysis developed for thermal transport in the disordered Fermi liquid and include scattering processes induced by the long-range Coulomb interaction in the sub-temperature energy range. For the thermal conductivity, unlike for the electrical conductivity, these scattering processes yield a logarithmic correction that may compete with the RG corrections. The interest in this correction arises from the fact that it violates the Wiedemann–Franz law. We checked that the sub-temperature correction to the thermal conductivity is not modified either by the inclusion of Fermi liquid interaction amplitudes or as a result of the RG flow. We therefore expect that the answer obtained for this correction is final.

Restricting ourselves to the homogeneous expansion, we analyze the disorder dependence of GL expansion coefficients for a wide range of attractive potentials U, from the weak BCS coupling region to the strong-coupling limit, where superconductivity is described by Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) of preformed Cooper pairs. We show that for the a semielliptic “bare” density of states of the conduction band, the disorder influence on the GL coefficients A and B before quadratic and quartic terms of the order parameter, as well as on the specific heat discontinuity at the superconducting transition, is of a universal nature at any strength of the attractive interaction and is related only to the general widening of the conduction band by disorder. In general, disorder growth increases the values of the coefficients A and B, leading either to a suppression of the specific heat discontinuity (in the weak-coupling limit), or to its significant growth (in the strong-coupling region). However, this behavior actually confirms the validity of the generalized Anderson theorem, because the disorder dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T c, is also controlled only by disorder widening of the conduction band (density of states).@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27150566@JETP

To solve this task, the dielectric permittivity, the magnetic permeability, and the loss tangent are measured in La x Bi1-x FeO3 films in magnetic fields of up to 8 kOe in the range of temperatures 100 K < T < 1000 K. Maxima of the permittivity and permeability at low temperatures and the dependence of the permeability on the prehistory of a sample are found. An increase in the magnetocapacitance due to the substitution of lanthanum for bismuth is observed. A giant enhancement of magnetocapacitance in an external electric bias field is revealed.

Two spectroscopic cells having strongly different values of the relaxation rates γrel are used: an Rb cell with antirelaxation coating (L ~ 1 cm) and an Rb nanometric- thin cell (nanocell) with a thickness of the atomic vapor column L = 795 nm. For the EIT in the nanocell, we have the usual EIT resonances characterized by a reduction in the absorption (dark resonance (DR)), whereas for the EIT in the Rb cell with an antirelaxation coating, the resonances demonstrate an increase in the absorption (bright resonances (BR)). We suppose that such an unusual behavior of the EIT resonances (i.e., the reversal of the sign from DR to BR) is caused by the influence of an alignment process. The influence of alignment strongly depends on the configuration of the coupling and probe frequencies as well as on the configuration of the magnetic field.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26856574@JETP

In this case, heat from a hot to cold wall is removed through a vapor–liquid layer via heat conduction. The boundary conditions that take into account liquid evaporation (appearance of a mass flux) at the vapor–liquid phase surface and the temperature dependence of the saturation pressure are derived. Dispersion equations are obtained. The wave processes for the stable (light vapor under a liquid layer) and unstable stratifications of the phases at rest and during their relative motion are studied. The deformation of the phase boundary results in liquid evaporation, changes in the boiling temperature and the saturation pressure, and generation of weakly damped low-amplitude waves of a new type. These waves ensure the stability of a vapor film under a liquid layer at rest or a liquid layer moving at a constant velocity in the gravity field. The velocities of these waves are much higher than the gravity wave velocities. The critical heat flows and wavelengths at which wave boiling regimes at normal pressure can exist are determined, and the calculated and experimental data are compared.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24950164@JETP

We assume that the plasma consists of two species of ions neglecting of electrons. We take into account charging of the sphere due to sedimentation of plasma ions on it, the field of the sphere charge and the space charge, as well as recombination and molecular diffusion. The nonstationary problem of interaction of the sphere with the surrounding plasma is solved numerically. The temporal dynamics of the sphere charge and plasma perturbations is analyzed, as well as the properties of the stationary state. It is shown that the duration of transient period is determined by the recombination time and by the reverse conductivity of ions. The temporal dynamics of the sphere charge and plasma perturbations is determined by the intensity of recombination processes relative to the influence of the space charge field and diffusion. The stationary absolute value of the sphere charge increases linearly with the external electric field, decreases with the relative intensity of recombination processes and increases in the presence of substantial diffusion. The scales of the perturbed region in the plasma are determined by the radius of the sphere, the external field, the effect of diffusion, and the relative intensity of recombination processes. In the limiting case of the absence of molecular diffusion and a strong external field, the properties of the stationary state coincide with those obtained earlier as a result of approximate solution.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24941874@JETP

For the large spin/mass ratio, a ≫ m, the BH loses horizons and acquires a naked singular ring creating two-sheeted topology. This space is regularized by the Higgs mechanism of symmetry breaking, leading to an extended particle that has a regular spinning core compatible with the external KN solution. We show that this core has much in common with the known MIT and SLAC bag models, but has the important advantage of being in accordance with the external gravitational and electromagnetic fields of the KN solution. A peculiar two-sheeted structure of Kerr’s gravity provides a framework for the implementation of the Higgs mechanism of symmetry breaking in configuration space in accordance with the concept of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. Similar to other bag models, the KN bag is flexible and pliant to deformations. For parameters of a spinning electron, the bag takes the shape of a thin rotating disk of the Compton radius, with a ring–string structure and a quark-like singular pole formed at the sharp edge of this disk, indicating that the considered lepton bag forms a single bag–string–quark system.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24950271@JETP

The model adopted here (absence of dielectric interfaces in the structures under investigation) makes it possible to get rid of mixing of polarizations on the surfaces of the CLC layer and of the defect structure and to reduce the corresponding equations to only the equations for light with polarization diffracting in the CLC. The dispersion equations determining connection of the edge mode (EM) and defect mode (DM) frequencies with the CLC layer parameters (anisotropy of local absorption, CLC order parameter) and other parameters of the DMS are obtained. Analytic expressions for the transmission and reflection coefficients of CLC layer and DMS for the case of CLC with an anisotropic local absorption are presented and analyzed. It is shown that the CLC layers with locally anisotropic absorption reduce the EM and DM lifetimes (and increase the lasing threshold) in the way different from the case of CLC with an isotropic local absorption. Due to the Borrmann effect revealing of which is different at the opposite stop-band edges in the case of CLC layers with an anisotropic local absorption the EM life-times for the EM frequencies at the opposite stop-bands edges may be significantly different.

There the role of JT effect, although widely recognized, is still elusive in the ground state properties. Here we discovered that, in these materials, there exist excitations whose energy spectrum is described in terms of the total angular momentum eigenstates and is quantized as in quantum rotors found in JT centers. We observed features originating from these excitations in the optical spectra of a model compound LaMnO3 using ellipsometry technique. They appear clearly as narrow sidebands accompanying the electron transition between the JT split orbitals at neighboring Mn3+ ions, displaying anomalous temperature behavior around the Néel temperature T N ≈ 140 K. We present these results together with new experimental data on photoluminescence found in LaMnO3, which lend additional support to the ellipsometry implying the electronic-vibrational origin of the quantum rotor orbital excitations.

This new result of the linear theory of hydrodynamic stability is obtained by abandoning traditional assumption of the longitudinal periodicity of disturbances in the flow direction. It is established that previous notions about linear stability of this flow at arbitrarily large Reynolds numbers relied directly upon the assumed separation of spatial variables of the field of disturbances and their longitudinal periodicity in the linear theory. By also abandoning these assumptions for plane Poiseuille flow, a new threshold Reynolds number Reth ≈ 1035 is obtained, which agrees to within 4% with experiment—in contrast to 500% discrepancy for the previous estimate of Reth ≈ 5772 obtained in the framework of the linear theory under assumption of the “normal” shape of disturbances [2].@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26837536@JETP

It has been shown that there are four different self-similar flow regimes corresponding to four individual similarity parameters one of which is the known Clauser parameter and the three other parameters have been established for the first time. At adverse pressure gradient, when the exponent m lies in a certain range depending on Reynolds number, the problem has two solutions with different values of the boundary-layer thickness and skin friction; consequently, hysteresis in a pre-separation flow is possible. Separation occurs not at the minimal value of m that corresponds to the strongest adverse pressure gradient, but at m = −0.216 −0.4 Re  p  −1/3  + O(Re  p  −2/3 ), where Re p  is the Reynolds number based on longitudinal pressure gradient.

The theoretical study of superradiance processes is based both on the method of an averaged ponderomotive force and on direct numerical PIC (particle in cell) simulations. The analysis is performed in the K′ reference frame comoving with the electrons followed by the recalculation of radiation characteristics to the laboratory frame using the Lorentz transformations. Within the framework of the averaged approach, the electron bunch is represented as an ensemble of macroelectrons interacting between themselves through the radiation fields and Coulomb forces. The superradiance effect includes particle bunching followed by coherent emission of a single intense pulse from the entire volume of an electron bunch whose length exceeds considerably the wavelength. PIC simulations of this process based on the KARAT code have been performed for a more detailed analysis including the transverse inhomogeneity of the undulator field, the relativistic pattern of electron motion in this field, etc. A considerable simplification of the calculation procedure when passing to the comoving reference frame due to the commensurability of all spatial scales, including the radiation wavelength, the bunch length, and the length of the train of the pump wave into which the undulator field is transformed, is shown to be possible.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24006512@JETP

The roll structures in twisted nematics are characterized by the presence of an axial component of the hydrodynamic flow velocity with opposite directions in neighboring rolls. The critical oscillation frequency of structural defects is quantitatively estimated using a nonlinear equation of motion for roll displacements. It is found that a pair of edge dislocations with topological charges of +1 and–1 nucleates and annihilates periodically during the oscillations of a defect with a nonsingular core. Oscillating defects with a zero topological charge is shown to correspond to the solution of the sine-Gordon equation in the form of standing breathers. Asymmetry is detected in the full oscillation cycle of a breather defect, and it is related to the twist symmetry of a twist nematic. This asymmetry is taken into account as effective anisotropic friction. The behavior of a breather on a trap, namely, a classical defect (dislocation), is investigated. Dislocation motion is shown to be anisotropic in the oscillation cycle: in one direction, a dislocation moves regularly; in the second phase, the transition into the initial state proceeds via the decay of the breather into a dipole pair of dislocations of opposite signs followed by their annihilation.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26855211@JETP

Analytical results for the time evolution of mutual information, classical part of correlations, and quantum part characterized by quantum discord have been obtained within the central-spin model in the high-temperature approximation. The same formulas describe discord in both free induction decay and spin echo although the time and magnetic field dependences are different because of difference in the parameters entering into the formulas. Changes in discord in the presence of the nuclear polarization β I  in addition to the electron polarization β S  have been calculated. It has been shown that the method of reduction of the density matrix to a two-spin electron-nuclear system provides a qualitatively correct description of pair correlations playing the main role at β S  ≈ β I  and small times. At large times, such correlations decay and multispin correlations ensuring nonzero mutual information and zero quantum discord become dominant.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24033728@JETP

The calculation has been carried out beyond the single-electron and mean-field approximations with the fundamentally exact inclusion of Coulomb and exchange correlations of all orders and the spin variable. Distributions over the eigenfunctions of the spin-squared operator, as well as the equilibrium spin numbers, have been obtained depending on the shape of a quantum dot and the temperature. The complete set of basis functions symmetrized in permutations according to the spin of the system has been obtained by application of the Young symmetry operators. The dependence of the energy on the shape of the quantum dot corresponds to the negative sign of the surface tension at its boundary. The calculation indicates that the spin magnetic susceptibility in the system of two electrons decreases strongly for spherical quantum dots (“pairing” of spins) and the temperature dependences have a pronounced maximum whose position depends on the shape of the quantum dot. For three electrons in an oblate quantum dot, the inversion of the energy levels of spin states is observed and affects the spin magnetic susceptibility. The results indicate a strong dependence of the energy of collective spin states of electrons on the detailed inclusion of exchange and Coulomb spatial correlations.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23973696@JETP

While solutions to the shallow water equations for a neutral fluid are well known, shallow water magnetohydrodynamic (SMHD) equations over a nonflat boundary have an additional dependence on the magnetic field, and the number of equations in the magnetic case exceeds that in the neutral case. As a consequence, the number of Riemann invariants defining SMHD equations is also greater. The classical simple wave solutions do not exist for hyperbolic SMHD equations over an arbitrary surface due to the appearance of a source term. In this paper, we suggest a more general definition of simple wave solutions that reduce to the classical ones in the case of zero source term. We show that simple wave solutions exist only for underlying surfaces that are slopes of constant inclination. All self-similar discontinuous and continuous solutions are found. Exact explicit solutions of the initial discontinuity decay problem over a slope are found. It is shown that the initial discontinuity decay solution is represented by one of four possible wave configurations. For each configuration, the necessary and sufficient conditions for its realization are found. The change of dependent and independent variables transforming the initial equations over a slope to those over a flat plane is found.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24001946@JETP

The influence of annealing on the relaxation of bending stresses is studied. Preliminary annealing is found to sharply decrease the relaxation rate of bending stresses, and the initial stage of fast relaxation of these stresses is absent. Complete straightening of preliminarily annealed ribbons is shown to occur at significantly higher temperatures than that of the initial ribbons. Incomplete straightening of the ribbons is explained by the fact that bending stresses relaxation at high annealing temperatures proceeds due to both reversible anelastic deformation and viscous flow, which is a fully irreversible process. Incomplete reversibility is also caused by irreversible processes, such as the release of excess free volume and clustering (detected by small-angle X-ray scattering). The revealed differences in the relaxation processes that occur in the cobalt- and iron-based amorphous alloys are discussed in terms of different atomic diffusion mobilities in these alloys.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23996861@JETP

Explicit expressions are obtained for a transient current produced by an instantly applied weak electric field. The current relaxes to a stationary state for a time ħ/Γ (Γ is the width of a resonance level), oscillating at a frequency of ξ = ɛ − ɛ R , where ɛ is the energy of electrons coming from an emitter and ɛ R  is the resonance level energy. The transient current for interacting electrons is found in the quasi-classical approximation. It is shown that interaction between electrons can drastically change the transient current, especially in the presence of hysteresis of the current-voltage characteristic (CVC). Near extreme CVC values in the region of negative differential conductivity, the oscillation frequency tends to zero and becomes imaginary, compensating the decay. Thus, the transient current relaxes with very large times without oscillations. In contrast, in the case of positive differential conductivity, the oscillation frequency becomes very high, while the relaxation time remains the same, 1/Γ.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23971716@JETP

The uni-directional anisotropy in FM regions exchange-coupled to a FeMn antiferromagnet (AFM) film in the form of square mesh stripes is alternated by the uniaxial anisotropy in the FM regions inside this mesh. It is shown that the boundaries formed along the edges of these stripes, which separate FM regions with different anisotropy, crucially influence the kinetics of domain-structure transformation in both types of FM regions. It is established that the lateral exchange anisotropy in the ferromagnet, which is determined by the stabilization of the spin distribution in the FM layer along the FM-(FM/AFM) interface, leads to the asymmetry of the magnetization reversal in FM regions bordered with an FM/AFM structure. Anisotropy of the mobility of 180-degree “charged” and “uncharged” domain walls situated, respectively, perpendicular and parallel to the unidirectional anisotropy axis is revealed. The difference observed between the mobilities of charged and uncharged domain walls is attributed to the difference in the spin distribution in these walls with respect to the unidirectional anisotropy axis and is a key factor for the difference between the magnetization reversal kinetics in horizontal and vertical exchange-biased FM stripes. Drastic differences are revealed in the asymmetry of magnetization reversal processes in mutually perpendicular narrow stripes of FM/AFM structures. Possible mechanisms of magnetization reversal in low-dimensional FM-(FM/AFM) heterostructures are discussed with regard to the effect of domain walls localized on the edges of AFM layers.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23958499@JETP

The Ba adsorption is found to induce the appearance of a new photoemission peak in the bandgap at the Fermi level in the Ba/n-GaN and Ba/n-Al0.16Ga0.84N interfaces.

The following methods of calculating the electronic spectrum are analyzed: the Kohn-Sham equations of the density functional theory (DFT), the hybrid functional method, the GW approximation, and the Lehmann approximation used in the spectral representation of one-electron Green’s function. The results of these approaches are compared with the data of photoemission measurements of benzene, PTCDA, and phthalocyanine (CuPc, H2Pc, FePc, PtPc) molecules, which are typical representatives of organic molecular semiconductors (OMS). This comparison demonstrates that the Kohn-Sham equations of DFT incorrectly reproduce the electronic spectrum of OMS. The hybrid functional method correctly describes the spectrum of the valence and conduction bands; however, the HOMO-LUMO gap width is significantly underestimated. The correct gap width is obtained in both the GW approximation and the Lehmann approach, and the total energy in this approach can be calculated in the local density approximation of DFT.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23996905@JETP

We distinguish two processes of this kind. In the process of ionization, a quasiparticle present in the Andreev bound state is transferred to the delocalized states leaving the constriction. The refill process involves two quasiparticles: one flies away while another one appears in the Andreev bound state. We notice an interesting asymmetry of these processes. The electron-like quasiparticles are predominantly emitted to one side of the constriction while the hole-like ones are emitted to the other side. This produces a charge imbalance of accumulated quasiparticles, that is opposite on opposite sides of the junction.

One of the possible causes is the presence of an Eu3+ impurity in a sample. A nonempirical polarizable ion model is used to study the effect of a trivalent Eu3+ ion impurity on the antiferrodistortion and ferroelectric instabilities of an EuTiO3 crystal in the bulk and the thin-film states. Lattice dynamics calculation shows that a bulk impurity-free EuTiO3 crystal has no unstable modes throughout the entire phase space volume. The addition of an Eu3+ impurity leads to a significant softening of the rotational mode, the distortion in which makes tetragonal phase I4/mcm (which is experimentally observed) energetically favorable. In going from the bulk crystal to the thin film, the vibration spectrum of the impurity-free film has unstable antiferrodistortion and rotational modes.

Such clusters appear after the Jordan-Wigner transformation of a spin chain governed by the nearest-neighbor XY Hamiltonian with the particular initial state having one polarized node. We show that the quantum discord stationarity in such systems is not destroyed by the “parasitic” polarization of at least two types. The first type appears because the initial state with a single polarized node is hardly realizable experimentally, and therefore the low polarization of neighboring nodes must be taken into account. The second is the unavoidable additional noise polarization of all nodes. Although the stationarity may not be destroyed by perturbations of the above two types, the parasitic polarizations deform the pairwise discord distribution and may destroy clusters of correlated fermions with equal pairwise discords.

In the absence of such separation of variables in the developed linear theory, it has been proposed to use a modification of the Bubnov-Galerkin theory that makes it possible to take into account the difference between the periods of the longitudinal variability for different radial modes preliminarily determined by the standard application of the Galerkin-Kantorovich method to the evolution equation of extremely small axisymmetric disturbances of the tangential component of the velocity field. It has been shown that the consideration of even two linearly interacting radial modes for the Hagen-Poiseuille flow can provide linear instability only in the presence of the mentioned conditionally periodic longitudinal variability of disturbances along the axis of the tube, when the threshold Reynolds number Reth(p) is very sensitive to the ratio p of two longitudinal periods each describing longitudinal variability for its radial disturbance mode. In this case, the threshold Reynolds number can tend to infinity, Reth(p) → ∞, only at p = p  k  = k, p = p 1/k  = 1/k, and p = p_{\sqrt k }  = [k + 1 \pm \sqrt {(k + 1)^2  - 4} ]/2p = p_{\sqrt k }  = [k + 1 \pm \sqrt {(k + 1)^2  - 4} ]/2, where k = 1, 2, 3, ….

Similarity of the mechanisms of linear viscous dissipative instability for the Hagen-Poiseuille flow and Tollmien-Schlichting waves has been discussed.

The parameter of this heating is the particle temperature, which is the same in the entire particle volume because of its small size and high conductivity. Three processes determine the particle heat balance: particle radiation, evaporation of metal atoms from the particle surface, and heat transport to the surrounding gas due to its thermal conductivity. The particle heat balance is analyzed based on these processes, which are analogous to those for bulk metals with the small particle size, and its high temperature taken into account. Outside the particle, where the gas temperature is lower than on its surface, the formed metal vapor in a buffer gas flow is converted into clusters. Clusters grow as a result of coagulation until they become liquid, and then clusters form fractal aggregates if they are removed form the gas flow. Subsequently, associations of fractal aggregates join into a fractal structure. The rate of this process increases in medium electric fields, and the formed fractal structure has features of aerogels and fractal fibers.

In each sample we observed Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations and sublinear dependence of off-diagonal component of magnetoresistance tensor on magnetic field. The periods of SdH oscillations in inverse magnetic field were found to be the same within 15%. The positions of SdH oscillations are determined by the normal to surface component of magnetic field. We found that the measured conductivity can be well described by a model with two groups of electrons, 2D and 3D. The conductivity of 2D electrons was found to be relatively weakly varying from sample to sample and not depending on thickness in a systematic manner. This behavior can be explained only by their localization on the surface. Comparison of the results of magnetotransport measurements with our scanning tunneling spectroscopy results on atomically smooth Bi2Te2Se surface in ultrahigh vacuum led us to conclude that the surface electrons are separated from the bulk electrons by a depletion layer approximately 100 nm thick.

Analysis of the characteristics of this self-modulation predicted [5] that the dependences of the probe pulse absorption on the pump pulse energy and picosecond delay between pump and probe pulses should be self-modulated by oscillations. Such self-modulation was experimentally observed in this work. Under certain conditions, absorption oscillations proved to be a function of part of the energy of picosecond stimulated emission of GaAs lying above a certain threshold in the region where the emission front overlapped the probe pulse front.

The first two mechanisms are associated with the stratification of a substance into ferromagnetic and nonferromagnetic phases, which significantly differ in electric resistivity. The dimensional mechanism of MR is attributed to the effect of a magnetic field on the size of magnetic inclusions. The orientational mechanism of MR is determined by the dependence of electric resistivity on the mutual orientation of the magnetizations of magnetic inclusions. The magnetic mechanism of MR is determined by the properties of the magnetization of a ferromagnet, in particular, by the Curie–Weiss singularity on the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility at the Curie point. This mechanism exists in homogeneous substances, although its value may depend on the magnetic properties of inhomogeneities. The method is developed for substances with activation-type conductivity and is applied to the analysis of MR of La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 manganite near the Curie point, where the MR attains its maximum. The dimensional mechanism turns out to be dominant in magnetic fields H greater than the saturation field H  s  (H > H  s ). The orientational, dimensional, and magnetic mechanisms have a comparable effect on the MR for H < H  s . The effect of the orientational mechanism on MR is relatively weak (does not exceed the third part of the total MR), although this mechanism determines the giant MR in multilayered metal films. The possibility of application of the method to the analysis of MR near the insulator–metal transition is analyzed.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26795222@JETP

To describe the dynamics of resonant processes accompanied by nonadiabatic transitions between ionic and Rydberg covalent terms of a quasimolecule, an approach based on the integration of coupled equations for the probability amplitudes has been developed taking into account the possibility of the decay of an anion in the Coulomb field of the positive ionic core of a highly excited atom. The approach involves the specific features of the problem associated with the structure of the wavefunction of a Rydberg electron in states with high orbital angular momenta l ~ n–1. This approach provides a much more accurate description of the dynamics of electronic transitions at collisions between atoms than that within the modified semiclassical Landau–Zener model. In addition, this approach makes it possible to effectively take into account many channels of the problem. The cross sections for resonant quenching of Rydberg states of the Li(nlm) atom with given principal n, orbital l = n–1, and magnetic m quantum numbers at thermal collisions with the Ca(4s 2) and Sr(5s 2) atoms have been calculated. The dependences of the results on n, m, and angle α between the relative velocity of the atoms and the normal to the plane of the orbit of the Rydberg electron have been obtained. The influence of orientational effects on the efficiency of the collisional destruction of circular and near-circular states has been studied. The results indicate a higher stability of such states to their perturbations by neutral particles as compared to usually studied nl states with low values of l (l ≪ n).@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26794450@JETP

The contributions of the first type are related to the intrinsic magnetic moment of a fermion representing an additional source of electromagnetic radiation. The contributions of the second type have the opposite sign and are caused by a small change in the electron acceleration appearing due to the Frenkel addition to the particle mass. Contributions of the second type dominate, which explains the “wrong” sign of total spin corrections. We show that not only the sign but also the values of coefficients can be explained with specified accuracy using classical electrodynamics if corrections to the mass shift (action) and radiation power are calculated in canonical variables, i.e., for fixed velocity and momentum values, respectively. The results can be treated as a demonstration of the correspondence principle in the field of radiative spin effects, in addition to correspondence between classical and quantum theories at the tree (in the external filed) level.

However, the insufficiently high value of the Curie temperature T C of these compounds is a barrier to their widespread use. The increase in the Curie temperature of these compounds is achieved by doping with the light nonmetallic atoms such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. In this paper, it is shown numerically that this doping leads to drastic changes of the electronic band dispersions in a wide energy region around the Fermi level. This in turn changes values of the magnetic moments of ions and Heisenberg exchange interaction parameters. The values of ab initio calculated magnetic moments and direct exchange interaction parameters make it possible to calculate the Curie temperatures for both parent and nitrogen-doped compounds within the mean-field approach to the Heisenberg model in the sample of YFe11Mo, a typical representative of the R(Fe,M)12L class.

These materials exhibit interesting properties in a magnetic field. In this work, we investigate the Landau bands and the density of states (DOS) oscillations in a Weyl semimetal in crossed magnetic and electric fields. An expression is obtained for the energy spectrum of the system using the following three different methods: an algebraic approach, a Lorentz shift-based approach, and a quasi-classical approach. It is interesting that the energy spectrum calculated in terms of the quasi-classical approach coincides with the spectrum obtained using the microscopic approaches. An electric field is shown to change the Landau bands radically. In addition, the classical motion of a three-dimensional Dirac fermion in crossed fields is studied. In the case of a Dirac spectrum, the longitudinal (with respect to magnetic field) component of momentum (pz ǁ H) is shown to be an oscillating function of the magnetic field. When the electric field is v⊥H/c, the Landau levels collapse and the motion becomes fully linear in an unusual manner. In this case, the wavefunction of bulk states vanishes and only states with pz = 0 are retained. An electric field affects the character of DOS oscillations. An analytical expression is obtained for the quantum capacitance in crossed fields in the cases of strong and weak electric fields. Thus, an electric field is an additional parameter for adjusting the diamagnetic properties of Weyl semimetals.

Based on our VPM, we formulate and prove the relativistic Levinson theorem. The problem of bound states can be reduced to the analysis of closed trajectories of some vector field. Remarkably, the Levinson theorem appears as the Poincaré index theorem for these closed trajectories. The VPM equation is also reduced to the nonrelativistic and semiclassical limits. The limit of a small momentum p y of transverse quantization is applicable to an arbitrary integrable potential. In this case, a single confined mode is predicted.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27092975@JETP

The stoichiometric GeSe2 and GeS2 glasses exhibit elastic behavior in the pressure range up to 3 GPa, and their bulk modulus decreases at pressures higher than 2–2.5 GPa. At higher pressures, inelastic relaxation processes begin and their intensity is proportional to the logarithm of time. The relaxation rate for the GeSe2 glasses has a pronounced maximum at 3.5–4.5 GPa, which indicates the existence of several parallel structural transformation mechanisms. The nonstoichiometric glasses exhibit a diffuse transformation and inelastic behavior at pressures above 1–2 GPa. The maximum relaxation rate in these glasses is significantly lower than that in the stoichiometric GeSe2 glasses. All glasses are characterized by the “loss of memory” of history: after relaxation at a fixed pressure, the further increase in the pressure returns the volume to the compression curve obtained without a stop for relaxation. After pressure release, the residual densification in the stoichiometric glasses is about 7% and that in the Ge17Se83 glasses is 1.5%. The volume of the Ge8Se92 glass returns to its initial value within the limits of experimental error. As the pressure decreases, the effective bulk moduli of the Ge17Se83 and Ge8Se92 glasses coincide with the moduli after isobaric relaxation at the stage of increasing pressure, and the bulk modulus of the stoichiometric GeSe2 glass upon decreasing pressure noticeably exceeds the bulk modulus after isobaric relaxation at the stage of increasing pressure. Along with the reported data, our results can be used to draw conclusions regarding the diffuse transformations in glassy germanium chalcogenides during compression.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27576720@JETP

In connection with this, the photon phase space is discussed in more detail because it is nontrivial in the case of a polarized τ lepton. The decay matrix element contains both the inner bremsstrahlung and the resonance (structural) contributions. The azimuthal dependence of some observables are calculated. They are the asymmetry of the differential decay width caused by the τ-lepton polarization, the Stokes parameters of the emitted photon itself, and the correlation parameters describing the influence of τ-lepton polarization on the photon Stokes parameters. A numerical estimation is done in the τ-lepton rest frame for an arbitrary direction of the τ-lepton polarization 3-vector. The vector and axial-vector form factors describing the structure-dependent part of the decay amplitude are determined using the chiral effective theory with resonances (RχT). It is found that the features of the azimuthal distributions allows separating various terms in the spin-dependent contribution.

The problem of the energy balance in a target and the determination of the laser energy that should be used in the spherical model of the target has been considered. The results of action of pulses differing in energy and time profile (“low-foot” and “high-foot” regimes) have been analyzed. The parameters of the compression of targets with a high-density carbon ablator have been obtained. The results of the simulations are in satisfactory agreement with the measurements and correspond to the range of the observed parameters. The set of compared results can be expanded, in particular, for a more detailed determination of the parameters of a target near the maximum compression of the capsule. The physical foundation of the possibility of using the one-dimensional description is the necessity of the closeness of the last stage of the compression of the capsule to a one-dimensional process.

The energy barriers of oxygen diffusion between various interstices in the crystal lattice of the alloy are estimated, and the preferred migration paths in the (0001) plane and the [0001] direction are determined. It is found that the migration barrier from the most preferred octahedral O1 site to distorted tetrahedral Ti-site (2.42 eV) is a key barrier and limits the oxygen diffusion in the alloy.

We have determined the spectrum of gapless excitations close to zeroth shear modes for an arbitrary angle ϕ between the unit cell vectors. Analysis of the excitation spectra of triangular and square lattices with a single flux quantum in the unit cell has shown that solutions with a number of flux quanta greater than one exist at least in the range of parameters κ close to unity (κ > 1) and give smaller values of the free energy as compared to its values for a triangular lattice with a single flux quantum. For small values of momentum k (in the k 2 approximation), the excitation spectrum of the “transverse” mode in the triangular lattice is independent of the direction of the momentum lying in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field.

We consider the wide region of attractive potentials U from the weak coupling region, where superconductivity is described by BCS model, to the strong coupling region, where the superconducting transition is related with Bose–Einstein condensation (ВЕС) of compact Cooper pairs formed at temperatures essentially larger than the temperature of superconducting transition, and a wide range of disorder—from weak to strong, where the system is in the vicinity of Anderson transition. In the case of semielliptic bare density of states, disorder’s influence upon the coefficients A and В of the square and the fourth power of the order parameter is universal for any value of electron correlation and is related only to the general disorder widening of the bare band (generalized Anderson theorem). Such universality is absent for the gradient term expansion coefficient C. In the usual theory of “dirty” superconductors, the С coefficient drops with the growth of disorder. In the limit of strong disorder in BCS limit, the coefficient С is very sensitive to the effects of Anderson localization, which lead to its further drop with disorder growth up to the region of the Anderson insulator. In the region of BCS–ВЕС crossover and in ВЕС limit, the coefficient С and all related physical properties are weakly dependent on disorder. In particular, this leads to relatively weak disorder dependence of both penetration depth and coherence lengths, as well as of related slope of the upper critical magnetic field at superconducting transition, in the region of very strong coupling.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31088494@JETP

In this case, detection in the object arm is performed over the entire aperture of the beam and, therefore, it does not give information on the object. The reference beam does not interact with the object, but is recorded with a scanning point detector or a CCD array permitting the measurement of the spatial correlation function of photons in two arms. The use of multimode entangled quantum light beams by illuminating the object by one beam and orienting other beams to reference arms makes it possible to obtain simultaneously several ghost images (GIs). Cross correlations of multiplexed GIs (MGIs) are determined by eighth-order field correlation functions. A special algorithm is developed for calculating higher-order correlations of Bose operators. The presence of GI cross correlations is used for improving the quality of the reconstructed object’s image by their processing using the measurement reduction method. An example of the computer simulation of the image reconstruction by MGIs formed in the field of four-frequency entangled quantum states is considered.

This family contains the Gaussian and log-normal distributions, typical for the metallic and localized phases. For a certain choice of parameters, we reproduce the results for the cumulants of conductance in the space dimension d = 2 + ϵ obtained in the framework of the σ-model approach. The universal property of distributions is existence of two asymptotic regimes, log-normal for small g and exponential for large g. In the metallic phase they refer to remote tails, in the critical region they determine practically all distribution, in the localized phase the former asymptotics forces out the latter. A singularity at g = 1, discovered in numerical experiments, is admissible in the framework of their calculational scheme, but related with a deficient definition of conductance. Apart of this singularity, the critical distribution for d = 3 is well described by the present theory. One-parameter scaling for the whole distribution takes place under condition, that two independent parameters characterizing this distribution are functions of the ratio L/ξ.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31029846@JETP

Security is defined in terms different from the requirements imposed on keys in classical cryptography. In quantum cryptography, the security of keys is expressed in terms of the closeness of the quantum state of an eavesdropper after key distribution to an ideal quantum state that is uncorrelated to the key of legitimate users. A metric of closeness between two quantum states is given by the trace metric. In classical cryptography, the security of keys is understood in terms of, say, the complexity of key search in the presence of side information. In quantum cryptography, side information for the eavesdropper is given by the whole volume of information on keys obtained from both quantum and classical channels. The fact that the mathematical apparatuses used in the proof of key security in classical and quantum cryptography are essentially different leads to misunderstanding and emotional discussions [1]. Therefore, one should be able to answer the question of how different cryptographic robustness criteria are related to each other. In the present study, it is shown that there is a direct relationship between the security criterion in quantum cryptography, which is based on the trace distance determining the distinguishability of quantum states, and the criterion in classical cryptography, which uses guesswork on the determination of a key in the presence of side information.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31064054@JETP

2017@Беляков В А|@Edge localized modes cold neutrons periodic condensed media@1@It is found that for certain energies of discreet cold neutrons, quasi-stationary eigen solutions of the corresponding Schrodinger equation, which are localized in the layer of a periodic medium, exist. The localization time of these solutions is strongly dependent on the layer thickness, being finite for a finite layer thickness and increasing indefinitely upon a infinite growth of the layer thickness as the third power of the layer thickness. The problem has been solved in the two-wave approximation of the dynamic diffraction theory for the neutron propagation direction coinciding with the periodicity axes (normal incidence of the neutron beam on the layer). The expressions for neutron eigenwave functions in a periodic medium, the reflection and transmission coefficients, and the neutron wavefunction in the layer as a function of the neutron energy incident on the layer have been determined. It turns out that for the certain discrete neutron energies, the amplitudes of the neutron wavefunction in the layer reach sharp maxima. The corresponding energies are just outside of the neutron stop band (energies forbidden for neutron propagation in the layer) and determine the energies of neutron edge modes (NEMs) localized in the layer, which are direct analogs of the optical edge modes for photonic crystals. The dispersion equation for the localized neutron edge modes has been obtained and analytically solved for the case of thick layers. A rough estimate for the localization length L is L ~(db N)–1, where b is the neutron scattering length, d is the crystal period, and N is the density of nuclei in the crystal. The estimates of the localized thermal neutron lifetime show that acheaving of a lifetime close to the free neutron lifetime seems nonrealistic due to absorption of thermal neutrons and requires a perfect large size crystal. Nevertheless, acheaving the localized neutron lifetime exceeding by ~104 times the neutron time of flight through the layer appears as experimentally attainable. The perspectives of the NEM observation are briefly discussed. It is proposed to use NEM for ultrahigh thermal neutron monochromatization by means of NEM excitation in perfect single crystals.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31078963@JETP

Calculations are carried out within a microscopic model of a lipid bilayer, according to which the energy of a lipid chain represents the energy of a flexible string of finite thickness and the interaction between lipid chains is considered as a steric (entropic) repulsion. This microscopic model allows one to obtain an expression for the distribution of lateral pressure in membranes with given curvature if one considers the bending of a membrane as a small deviation from a flat conformation and applies perturbation theory in the small parameter L 0 J, where L 0 is the hydrophobic thickness of a monolayer and J is the mean curvature of the lipid bilayer. The resulting pressure profile depends on the microscopic parameters of the lipid chain: the bending modulus of the lipid chain, incompressible area per lipid chain, and the thickness of a flat monolayer. The coefficient of entropic repulsion between lipids is calculated self-consistently. The analytical results obtained for the lateral pressure distribution are in qualitative agreement with molecular dynamic simulations.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31054398@JETP

The passages of such clumps through the Earth are very rare events occurring once in 105 years. It has also been shown that the Earth’s passage through DM streams, which are the remnants of clumps destroyed by tidal gravitational forces from Galactic stars, is a much more probable event occurring once in several years. In this paper, we have performed detailed calculations of the destruction of miniclusters by taking into account their distribution in orbits in the Galactic halo. We have investigated two DM halo models, the Navarro–Frenk–White and isothermal density profiles. Apart from the Galactic disk stars, we have also taken into account the halo and bulge stars. We show that about 2–5% of the axion miniclusters are destroyed when passing near stars and transform into axion streams, while the clump destruction efficiency depends on the DM halo model. The expected detection rate of streams with an overdensity exceeding an order of magnitude is 1–2 in 20 years.

It has been shown that an important parameter is the ratio L/λ, where λ = 795 nm is the wavelength of laser radiation resonant with the D 1 line. The best parameters of the signal of rotation of the radiation polarization plane have been obtained at the thickness L = λ/2 = 397.5 nm. The fabricated nanocell had a large region with such a thickness. The spectral width of the signal reached at the thickness L = 397.5 nm is approximately 30 MHz, which is much smaller than the spectral width (≈ 500 MHz) reached with ordinary cells with a thickness in the range of 1–100 mm. The parameters of the Faraday rotation signal have been studied as functions of the temperature of the nanocell, the laser power, and the magnetic field strength. The signal has been reliably detected at the laser power P L ≥ 1 μW, magnetic field strength B ≥ 0.5 G, and the temperature of the nanocell T ≥ 100°C.

It is demonstrated that the negative derivative of the SR signal profile for L > λ/2 changes to the positive one for L < λ/2. It is shown that the real-time formation of the SR signal profile derivative (SRD) with the spectral width 30–40 MHz and located at the atomic transition is, in particular, a convenient frequency marker of D2 transitions in Rb and Cs. The amplitudes of SRD signals are proportional to the atomic transition probabilities. A comparison with the known saturated absorption (SA) method demonstrated a number of advantages, such as the absence of cross-over resonances in the SRD spectrum, the simplicity of realization, a low required power, etc. An SRD frequency marker also operates in the presence of the Ne buffer gas at a pressure of 6 Torr, which allowed us to determine the Ne–Rb collisional broadening, whereas the SA method is already inapplicable at buffer gas pressures above 0.1 Torr. The realization simplicity makes the SRD method a convenient tool for atomic spectroscopy. Our theoretical model well describes the SRD signal.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31046710@JETP

Unlike the frustrated YBaCo4O7 magnet, the softening of Young’s modulus and the hysteresis in the ΔE(T)/E 0 curve of ferrimagnetic CaBaCo4O7 in the paramagnetic region are weak, and the anomaly during the magnetic transition increases by almost an order of magnitude. This difference can point to different characters of the development of a long-range magnetic order in these two cobaltites. The distortion of the crystal structure that removes the frustrations of exchange interactions is found to correlate with the magnetic behavior of the cobaltites under study. The magnetization curves of the Ca cobaltite have two steps below 15 K, which can point to the presence of a metastable state in a high magnetic field. The study of the longitudinal and transverse magnetoelectric effects in a pulsed magnetic field demonstrates that their magnitudes are maximal near T  C  and change their character from linear to quadratic during passage through this temperature.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29475286@JETP

The wavefunctions of the ground and excited states are calculated in the single-configuration Hartree–Fock–Dirac approximation. The resultant photoabsorption spectra are compared with experimental data and with the results of calculations based on the nonrelativistic spin-polarized version of the random-phase approximation with exchange. Series of autoionization resonance peaks, as well as giant autoionization resonance lines corresponding to discrete transitions 3p → 3d, are clearly observed in the photoabsorption cross sections. The conformity of the positions of calculated peaks of giant autoionization resonances with experimental data is substantially improved by taking into account additionally the correlation electron–electron interaction based on the model of the dynamic polarization potential.

For this, we identify and generalize four-qubit W-type states. Our results show that these states can be used as resources for deterministic quantum information processing. The utility of results, however, is limited by the availability of experimental setups to perform and distinguish multiqubit measurements. We therefore emphasize protocols where two users want to establish an optimal bipartite entanglement using the partially entangled W-type states. We find that for such practical purposes, four-qubit W-type states can be a better resource in comparison to three-qubit W-type states. For a dense coding protocol, our states can be used deterministically to send two bits of classical message by locally manipulating a single qubit. In addition, we also propose a realistic experimental method to prepare the four-qubit W-type states using standard unitary operations and weak measurements.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=28268039@JETP

We consider an SM extension based on a stabilized brane-world model, in which the effective low-energy Lagrangian for the scalar degrees of freedom turns out to be very general and, for different values of the model parameters, reproduces the scalar field Lagrangians of various SM extensions by a singlet scalar. It is shown that in the simplest variant of the model, where only the gravitational degrees of freedom propagate in the bulk, the 125 GeV scalar state can be consistently interpreted as a Higgs-dominated state for a rather wide range of the model parameters, whereas the production cross section of a heavier radion-dominated state with mass 750 GeV or more turns out to be too small in the allowed region of the model parameter space for producing the wouldbe diphoton excess.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31043575@JETP

Typical examples of such actions are the effect of a pulsed magnetic field on charged particles in a gas or plasma. Coherent correlated states are characterized most comprehensively by the correlation coefficient r(t); an increase of this factor elevates the probability of particle tunneling through a high potential barrier by several orders of magnitude without an appreciable increase in their energy. It is shown for the first time that the formation of coherent correlated states, as well as maximal |r(t)|max and time-averaged 〈|r(t)|〉 amplitudes of the correlation coefficient and the corresponding tunneling probability are characterized by a nonmonotonic (oscillating) dependence on the forming pulse duration and amplitude. This result makes it possible to optimize experiments on the realization of low-energy nuclear fusion and demonstrates the incorrectness of the intuitive idea that the tunneling probability always increases with the amplitude of an external action on a particle. Our conclusions can be used, in particular, for explaining random (unpredictable and low-repeatability) experimental results on optimization of energy release from nuclear reactions occurring under a pulsed action with fluctuations of the amplitude and duration. We also consider physical premises for the observed dependences and obtain optimal relations between the aforementioned parameters, which ensure the formation of an optimal coherent correlated state and optimal low-energy tunneling in various physical systems with allowance for the dephasing action of a random force.

An exact solution has been obtained for the corresponding metric tensor in the case of a linear dependence of the mass function of the Vaidya metric on light coordinate v. In the diagonal coordinates, a narrow region (with a width proportional to the mass growth rate of a black hole) has been detected near the visibility horizon of the Vaidya accreting black hole, in which the metric differs qualitatively from the Schwarzschild metric and cannot be represented as a small perturbation. It has been shown that, in this case, a single set of diagonal coordinates (t, r) is insufficient to cover the entire range of initial coordinates (v, r) outside the visibility horizon; at least three sets of diagonal coordinates are required, the domains of which are separated by singular surfaces on which the metric components have singularities (either g 00 = 0 or g 00 = ∞). The energy–momentum tensor diverges on these surfaces; however, the tidal forces turn out to be finite, which follows from an analysis of the deviation equations for geodesics. Therefore, these singular surfaces are exclusively coordinate singularities that can be referred to as false fire-walls because there are no physical singularities on them. We have also considered the transformation from the initial coordinates to other diagonal coordinates (η, y), in which the solution is obtained in explicit form, and there is no energy–momentum tensor divergence.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29524689@JETP

In contrast to the two-level model of emitters, this process with such a configuration of operating transitions may occur without population inversion in the whole, if the doublet is prepared at the initial instant in a superposition (coherent) state. In the ideal case of a Hamilton system, in which the cavity losses and relaxation in the radiator ensemble are disregarded, the conservation laws are derived, which allow a substantial reduction of the dimension of the phase space of the model (ℝ11 → ℝ5) and the application of methods of dynamics of nonlinear systems for analyzing the three-level superradiance under these conditions. The possibility of different (both quasiperiodic and chaotic) scenarios of the three-level superradiance is demonstrated on the basis of Poincaré’s mappings.

Below the temperature T N for both samples, there are two types of localization of a thermalized muon with different temperature dependences of the precession frequency of the magnetic moment of the muon in an internal magnetic field. The higher frequency in both samples refers to the initial antiferromagnetic matrix. The behavior of this frequency in Eu0.8Ce0.2Mn2O5 follows the Curie–Weiss law with the exponent β = 0.29 ± 0.02, which differs from the value β = 0.39 standard for 3D Heisenberg magnetics and is observed in EuMn2O5, because of the strong frustration of the doped sample. The temperature-independent low frequency is due to the presence of Mn3+–Mn4+ ferromagnetic pairs located along the b axis of the antiferromagnetic matrix and in the regions of phase separation, which contain such ion pairs and e  g  electrons recharging them. In both samples, polarization losses are the same (about 20%) and are associated with the formation of Mn4+–Mn4+ + Mu complexes near Mn3+–Mn4+ ferromagnetic pairs. In the temperature interval from 25 to 45 K, the separation of the Eu0.8Ce0.2Mn2O5 structure into two fractions where the relaxation rates of polarization of muons differ by an order of magnitude is revealed.

It is observed that the interplay of strongly coupled spin and charge degrees of freedom creates the regimes of irregular dynamics in both coordinate and spin channels. The border between the regular and irregular regimes determined by the strength and frequency of the driving field is found analytically within the quasiclassical approach by means of the Ince–Strutt diagram for the Mathieu equation, and is supported by full quantum-mechanical simulations of the driven dynamics. The investigation of quasienergy spectrum by Floquet approach reveals the presence of non-Poissonian level statistics, which indicates the possibility of chaotic quantum dynamics and corresponds to the areas of parameters for irregular regimes within the quasiclassical approach. We find that the influence of weak disorder leads to partial suppression of the dynamical chaos.

Analysis shows that the critical impact velocity V  c  (separating the damage and fragmentation regions) is a power function of σ p  and h/D. In the supercritical region (V > V  c ), the weight-average fragment mass asymptotically tends to a power function of the impact velocity with exponent independent of h/D and σ p .

Similarity coefficients are introduced for the ratio convection dissipation/convection generation (s) and the ratio thermal convection/compositional convection (r). The third new and most important coefficient δ is the ratio of the characteristic size normal to the axis of rotation to the layer thickness. The faster the rotation, the lower δ. In the case of the liquid Earth core, δ ~ 10–3 substitutes for the generally accepted Ekman number (E ~ 10–15) and s ~ 10–6 substitutes for the inverse Rayleigh number 1/Ra ~ 10–30. It is found that, at turbulent transport coefficients, number s and the Prandtl number are on the order of unity for any objects and δ is independent of transport coefficients. As a result of expansion in powers of δ, an initially 3D system of six variables is simplified to an almost 2D system of four variables without δ. The problem of convection excitation in the main volume is algebraically solved and this problem for critical values is analytically solved. Dispersion relations and general expressions for critical wavenumbers, numbers s (which determine Rayleigh numbers), other critical parameters, and asymptotic solutions are derived.

The field and the radiation pattern of each source are calculated in the case where the source frequency is equal to one of the surface plasmon resonance frequencies of the cylindrical scatterers. It is shown that the presence of even a single resonant magnetized plasma scatterer of small electrical radius or a few such scatterers significantly affects the total fields of the filamentary sources, so that their radiation patterns become essentially different from those in the absence of scatterers or the presence of isotropic scatterers of the same shape and size.

The TQ-bifurcations considered are implemented in discrete mappings and are related to the qualitative rearrangement of the shape of trajectories in an extended space of states. Within the demonstration of the main capabilities of the toolkit, an analysis is carried out of a logistic mapping in a domain to the right of the period-doubling limit point. Five critical values of the parameter are found for which the geometric structure of the trajectories of the mapping experiences a qualitative rearrangement.

In particular, the f(R) theory has been investigated extensively due to important f(R) gravity models in cosmological contexts. This paper is devoted to exploring an anisotropic universe in metric f(R) gravity. A locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type I cosmological model is considered for this purpose. Exact solutions of modified field equations are obtained for a well-known f(R) gravity model. The energy conditions are also discussed for the model under consideration. The viability of the model is investigated via graphical analysis using the present-day values of cosmological parameters. The model satisfies null energy, weak energy, and dominant energy conditions for a particular range of the anisotropy parameter while the strong energy condition is violated, which shows that the anisotropic universe in f(R) gravity supports the crucial issue of accelerated expansion of the universe.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29544371@JETP

Our extensive LDA+DMFT calculations show that correlation effects on Fe-3d states can almost quantitatively reproduce rather complicated band structure, which is observed in ARPES, in close vicinity of the Fermi level for FeSe/STO. Rather unusual shallow electron-like bands around the M-point in the Brillouin zone are well reproduced. Detailed analysis of the theoretical and experimental quasiparticle bands with respect to their origin and orbital composition is performed. It is shown that for FeSe/STO system the LDA calculated Fe-3dxy band, renormalized by electronic correlations within DMFT gives the quasiparticle band almost exactly in the energy region of the experimentally observed “replica” quasiparticle band at the Mpoint. However, correlation effects alone are apparently insufficient to eliminate the hole-like Fermi surfaces around the Γ-point, which are not observed in most ARPES experiments. The Fermi surfaces remain here even if Coulomb and/or Hund interaction strengths are increased while overall agreement with ARPES worsens. Increase of number of electrons also does not lead to vanishing of this Fermi surface and makes agreement of LDA+DMFT results with ARPES data much worse. We also present some simple estimates of “forward scattering” electron-optical phonon interaction at FeSe/STO interface, showing that it is apparently irrelevant for the formation of “replica” band in this system and significant increase of superconducting Tc.

For this purpose, the effects of external periodic forcing on two systems that have different dimensions and quantum spinor numbers and have been obtained under the use of Heisenberg ansatz are investigated by constructing their Poincaré sections in phase space.

This leads to a random change in the coordinate of the test molecule, which eventually results in the diffusion motion of the test particle in space. Two models parameters of interaction of a particle and a liquid are used to find the activation energy of the diffusion process under consideration: the gas-kinetic cross section for scattering of test molecules in the parent gas and the Wigner–Seitz radius for test molecules. In the context of this approach, we have calculated the diffusion coefficient of atoms and molecules in water, where based on experimental data, we have constructed the dependence of the activation energy for the diffusion of test molecules in water on the interaction parameter and the temperature dependence for diffusion coefficient of atoms or molecules in water within the models considered. The statistically averaged difference of the activation energies for the diffusion coefficients of different test molecules in water that we have calculated based on each of the presented models does not exceed 10% of the diffusion coefficient itself.

The main mechanism of instability saturation is considered to be a cascade of decays of a primary daughter electron Bernstein wave, which leads to the excitation of localized secondary electron Bernstein waves and ion cyclotron (Bernstein) waves. The localization of electron Bernstein waves causes a significant decrease in the secondary- decay excitation threshold, which is thought to provide saturation of the primary instability at the lowest level.

Two groups containing four atomic transitions form in an applied magnetic field upon pumping by radiation with circular polarization σ+ or σ–. Different intensities (probabilities) of transitions for the σ+ and σ– excitations are detected in magnetic field B0 ≈ Ahfs/μB ≈ 165 G (Ahfs is the magnetic dipole constant for the ground state and μB is the Bohr magneton).

A variational approach allowing the prediction of the global evolution of localized fields with the initially plane phase front was developed. The self-consistent equations are obtained for the main parameters of such beams (the position of the center of mass, the effective width, and linear and quadratic phase-front corrections) in the aberrationless approximation. The case of radiation incident on a periodic system of nonlinear optical fibers at an angle to the axis oriented along them is analyzed in detail. It is shown that for the radiation power exceeding a critical value, the self-focusing of the wave field is observed, which is accompanied by the shift of the intensity maximum followed by the concentration of the main part of radiation only in one of the structural elements of the array under study. In this case, the beams propagate along paths considerably different from linear and the direction of their propagation changes compared to the initial direction.

This effect appears as a result of the so-called kinetic mixing and is characterized by the small parameter describing the intensity of the interaction of the dark photon with charged Standard Model (SM) particles in terms of electric charge e. The search for a manifestation of A′ in this process is advantageous since the background to the A′ signal is purely electrodynamic and, hence, can be calculated with the required accuracy. We calculate this background taking into account the identity of final electrons. As regards A′, its contribution is taken into account only in Compton-type diagrams (of virtual Compton scattering) in which a virtual dark photon is a time-like particle and its propagator has the form of a Breit–Wigner resonance. It is only in the vicinity of resonance that A′ can be manifested. We calculate the invariant mass distribution of both e+e– pairs formed in the process and analyze the kinematic region in which relatively small squares of momenta transferred from the target electron to the formed electrons are excluded. In these conditions, the contribution to the differential cross section from Compton-type diagrams is not suppressed relative to the contribution of the remaining (Borsellino) diagrams. A number of limitations on parameter depending on the dark photon mass and the statistics (number) of events are obtained for a special method of gathering events in which the invariant mass of one e+e– pair remains fixed and of the other pair is scanned.

It is shown that depending on the properties of the bodies, the interacting surfaces polarize the liquid differently, and wetting properties of the surfaces are completely characterized by two parameters. If the surfaces are hydrophilic, liquid molecules are polarized at right angles to the surfaces, and the interaction is the short-range repulsion (the forces of interaction decrease exponentially over the characteristic length λ ≈ 0.2 nm). The interaction between the hydrophobic surfaces is more diversified and has been studied less. For L ≤ 3 nm, the interaction exhibits universal properties, while for L ≤ 3 nm, it considerably depends on the properties of the surfaces and on the distances between them, as well as on the composition of the polar liquid. In full agreement with the available experimental results we find that if the interfaces are mostly hydrophobic, then the interaction is attractive and long-range (the interaction forces diminish exponentially with decay length 1.2 nm). In this case, the resultant polarization of water molecules is parallel to the surface. It is shown that hydration forces are determined by nonlinear effects of polarization of the liquid in the bulk or by analogous nonlinearity of the interaction of water with a submerged body. This means that the forces of interaction cannot be calculated correctly in the linear response approximation. The forces acting between hydrophobic or hydrophilic surfaces are of the entropy type or electrostatic, respectively. It is shown that hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces for L ≤ 3 nm repel each other. The calculated intensity of their interaction is in agreement with experimental data. We predict the existence of an intermediate regime in which a body cannot order liquid molecules, which results in a much weaker attraction that decreases in inverse proportion to the squared distance between the surfaces of bodies. The difference between the microscopic structures of liquids confined in nanovolumes from liquids in large volumes is considered. The proposed model is applicable for a quantitative description of the properties of water at temperatures T satisfying the condition 0 < (T–Tc)/Tc ≪ 1, where Tc ≈ 230 K is the temperature of the ferroelectric phase transition observed in supercooled water. Under standard conditions, the model can be used for obtaining qualitative estimates.

A single-barrier magnetic tunnel junction with a nanoparticle embedded in an insulator forms a double-barrier magnetic tunnel junction. It has been shown that the in-plane component of the spin transfer torque in the double-barrier magnetic tunnel junction can be higher than that in the single-barrier one at the same thickness of the insulating layer. The calculations show that nanoparticles embedded in the tunnel junction increase the probability of tunneling of electrons, create resonance conditions, and ensure the quantization of the conductance in contrast to the tunnel junction without nanoparticles. The calculated dependences of the tunnel magnetoresistance correspond to experimental data demonstrating peak anomalies and suppression of the maximum magnetoresistances at low voltages.

The field dependences of magnetic susceptibility and magnetization are measured in the temperature range 100–270 K and magnetic fields up to 32 T. A significant increase in the temperature of the spin-reorientation antiferromagnet–ferromagnet phase transition is detected in samples enriched in heavy oxygen 18O (negative isotope effect). The transition temperature and the isotope effect depend strongly on the magnetic field. An H–T phase diagram is plotted for samples with various isotope compositions.

An approximate expression is obtained for the Mandelstam–Brillouin components of the dynamic structure factor of a bilayer. The analysis is based on a generalized hydrodynamic model of the “two-dimensional lipid bilayer + three-dimensional fluid medium” system, as well as on known sharp estimates for the frequencies and lifetimes of long-wavelength longitudinal acoustic phonons in a free hydrated lipid bilayer and in water, obtained from inelastic X-ray scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that, for characteristic values of the parameters of the membrane system, subterahertz longitudinal phonon-like excitations in the hydrophobic part of the bilayer are underdamped. In this case, the contribution of the viscous flow of the aqueous medium to the damping of a longitudinal membrane mode is small compared with the contribution of the lipid bilayer. Quantitative estimates of the damping ratio agree well with the experimental results for the vibration mode of the enzyme lysozyme in aqueous solution [1]. It is also shown that a coupling between longitudinal phonon modes of the bilayer and relaxation processes in its fluid environment gives rise to an additional peak in the scattering spectrum, which corresponds to a non-propagating mode.

The steady-state transmission regime is considered, for which detailed analysis of the kinetics of electrofluorescence formation in systems with symmetric and asymmetric couplings between the molecule and the electrodes is carried out. It is shown that the optically active state of the molecule is formed as a result of electron hops between the molecule and each of the electrodes, as well as due to inelastic interelectrode tunneling of the electron. The electrofluorescence power for a molecular diode (asymmetric 1M2 system) depends on the polarity of the voltage bias applied to the electrodes. The polarity is explained using a model in which the optically active part of the molecule (chromophore group) is represented by the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Two mechanisms of the emergence of polarity are revealed. One mechanism is associated with nonidentical Stark shifts of the HOMO and LUMO levels relative to the Fermi levels of the electrodes. The second mechanism is associated with the fact that the rates of an electron hopping between HOMO (LUMO) and one of the electrodes are much higher than the rates of such a hopping with the other electrode. The conditions in which each mechanism can be implemented experimentally are indicated.

The main difference between the model under consideration and the already existing models is the introduction of multiplicative particle acceleration at collisions. The introduction of acceleration transfers the consideration of walks to coordinate–momentum phase space, which allows both the spatial distribution of particles and their spectrum to be obtained. The kinetic equations in coordinate–momentum phase space have been derived for the case of walks with two possible states. This system of equations in a special case is shown to be reduced to ordinary Lévy walks. This system of kinetic equations admits of integration over the spatial variable, which transfers the consideration only to momentum space and allows the spectrum to be calculated.

For the rhombohedral Gd2Fe17 ferromagnet, we calculate the magnetic moments of iron and gadolinium ions, the parameters of exchange between Fe atoms, and Curie temperature TC at a zero pressure and during hydrostatic lattice compression. The magnetic moment of the unit cell of Gd2Fe17 is shown to decrease under pressure, and this decrease is almost completely associated with a decrease in the magnetic moments of Fe rather than Gd ions, the pressure dependence of the magnetic moments of which is weaker by an order of magnitude. In contrast to the hypothesis regarding the competition of exchange interactions between different kinds of Fe atoms, the parameters of exchange between the nearest iron atoms in different crystallographic sites are found to be positive ferromagnetic (at a zero pressure and during compression), and a ferromagnetic character of interaction is shown to remain unchanged under pressure even for Fe atoms in the so-called dumbbell sites with the nearest interatomic distances. The Curie temperature TC of Gd2Fe17 is shown to decrease with increasing pressure. The changes in the exchange parameters and the magnetic moments of Gd2Fe17 during compression are found to be mainly related to a change in the position of energy spectrum branches with respect to each other and the Fermi level ϵF rather than to a change in the overlapping of wavefunctions, which play a minor role.

At a weak deviation from oxygen stoichiometry, the structure distortion disappears, frustrations are retained, and the further development of a long-range magnetic order is hindered. As a result of an absent long-range magnetic order, the anomalies of the elastic characteristics at TN smooth rapidly and disappear.

In contrast to work [B. N. Libenson, J. Exp. Theor. Phys. 113, 553 (2011)], attention in this work is focused on the influence of surface effects on bulk-plasmon excitation by incident electrons. The probabilities and spectra of single characteristic energy loss of an intermediate- energy electron (50–500 eV) moving at an angle to the surface of the medium in three regions: in vacuum, in the medium, and again in vacuum after the electron leaves the medium are calculated. The kinetic approximation is used for the dielectric function, where the entire range of the plasmon spectrum is taken into account correctly for the problem under consideration. In the indicated energy range of incident electrons, surface effects, on the one hand, significantly reduces the probability of excitation of bulk plasma waves in the medium with strong spatial dispersion, in particular, as compared to the results obtained in [B.N. Libenson, J. Exp. Theor. Phys. 113, 553 (2011)], where surface effects were disregarded and the probability of bulkplasmon excitation by a 200-eV electron incident and emitted perpendicularly to the boundary is about one third of that in the unbounded medium. On the other hand, at grazing incidence from vacuum, the probability of transition radiation of bulk plasmons increases significantly and can lead to a change in the character of the angular dependence of the intensity of bulk plasma energy loss. Thus, the main result of this work is that a decrease in the glancing angle of the fast electron with respect to the vacuum–metal interface is accompanied both by an increase in the contribution from the transition mechanism to the probability of bulk-plasmon excitation in the vacuum region and by a decrease in the contribution from Cherenkov and bremsstrahlung mechanisms of excitation in the medium. The probability of bulk-plasmon excitation in the vacuum region exceeds the probability of excitation at the further motion of the electron in metallic aluminum at angles of incidence larger than 65°, 70°, and 75° at the energies E = 200, 350, and 500 eV, respectively.

Prominence is given to studying the possibility of bromine-isotope-selective suppression of the clustering of CF3Br molecules due to their resonance vibrational excitation in the gas-dynamic expansion zone near the nozzle. A continuous CO2 laser is used in experiments to excite molecules and clusters in a beam, and a quadrupole mass spectrometer is used to detect them. The experimental setup and the experimental technique are described. The dependences of the efficiency of molecule clustering suppression on the exciting laser radiation parameters, the gas parameters (composition, pressure) above the nozzle, and the distance from the nozzle exit section to a molecule irradiation zone are obtained. Bromine-isotope-selective suppression of molecule clustering is shown to occur at the exit from the nozzle due to the resonance vibrational excitation of gas-dynamically cooled CF3Br molecules. When CF3Br/Ar mixtures are used at pressure ratios p(CF3Br): p(Ar) = 1: 10 and 1: 30, the enrichment of a cluster beam by bromine isotopes are Kenr(81Br) ≈ 1.18 ± 0.09 and 1.12 ± 0.07 during the 9R(30) laser line (1084.635 cm–1) irradiation of a jet. The clustering suppression selectivity is α ≈ 1.18 when the mixture at the pressure ratio p(CF3Br): p(Ar) = 1: 10 is used.

The main conclusion is that the explanation of the yield of neutrons and γ-quanta at the interaction of hydrogen, helium, and neon ions with deuterated targets does not require “exotic” theoretical models.

2017@Делев В А|Крехов А П|@Structural Transformations Nematic Liquid Crystals Hybrid Orientation@0@"The structural transformations in a nematic liquid crystal (NLC) layer with a hybrid orientation (planar director orientation is created on one substrate and homeotropic director orientation is created on the other) are studied. In the case of a dc voltage applied to the NLC layer, the primary instability is flexoelectric. It causes the appearance of flexoelectric domains oriented along the director on the substrate with a planar orientation. When the voltage increases further, an electroconvective instability in the form of rolls moving almost normal to flexoelectric domains develops along with these domains. Thus, the following spatially periodic structures of different natures coexist in one system: equilibrium static flexoelectric deformation of a director and dissipative moving oblique electroconvection rolls. The primary instability in the case of an ac voltage is represented by electroconvection, which leads to moving oblique or normal rolls depending on the electric field frequency. Above the electroconvection threshold, a transition to moving “abnormal” rolls is detected. The wavevector of the rolls coincides with the initial director orientation on the substrate with a planar orientation, and the projection of the director at the midplane of the NLC layer on the layer plane makes a certain angle with the wavevector. The results of numerical calculations of the threshold characteristics of the primary instabilities agree well with the obtained experimental data.

Based on the ideas of the friction force of the external flow acting on the boundary of a jet, the entrainment equation for the external medium is derived that closes the system of equations of motion of turbulent jets. The physical meaning of the dissipation rate of the turbulent energy of a jet is interpreted as the work of the friction force. To describe the combustion kinetics, the limit of instantaneous reactions corresponding to the diffusion combustion mode is used. Calculations of the effective reaction rates for reactants and the volumes occupied by them are based on the representation of a turbulent medium as an aggregation of independent turbulent particles—vortices—whose random contacts lead to the mixing and combustion of reacting substances [31]. The concomitant phenomena of flow and combustion are analyzed, including radiation effects. In particular, it is shown that the apparent increase in the combustion temperature with increasing Reynolds number is in fact attributed to the relative decrease of thermal radiation losses. Qualitative agreement is obtained between the results of the theoretical calculations of the length of a combustion torch and experimental data.

This binary layered cobaltite single crystal has vacancies in the cobalt and oxygen sublattices, in contrast to the stoichiometric EuBaCo2O5.5 composition. All cobalt ions in EuBaCo1.9O5.36 are in a trivalent state. The single crystal has an orthorhombic structure with space group Pmmm, and its unit cell parameters are a = 3.883 Å, b = 7.833 Å, and c = 7.551 Å. The field and temperature dependences of the magnetization of the single crystal demonstrate that it is ferrimagnet below TC = 242 K. At T < 300 K, all three spin states of the Co3+ ions are present. The nearest-neighbor interactions give antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) contributions to the exchange energy. The ratio of the AFM to the FM contributions changes when temperature decreases because of a change in the spin state of the Co3+ ions. The single crystal exhibits signs of mictomagnetism at low temperatures in high magnetic fields. At T = 2 K and H = 90 kOe, the zero-field and nonzero-field magnetizations are strongly different because of a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, which tends to set magnetization along the magnetic field applied in cooling throughout the crystal volume. As a result, a complex ferrimagnetic structure with a noncollinear direction of Co3+ spins appears. The following phenomena characteristic of mictomagnets are also observed in the EuBaCo1.9O5.36 single crystal: a shift in a magnetization hysteresis loop when temperature decreases, retained hysteretic phenomena and no magnetization saturation in high magnetic fields, and an orientation transition. The mictomagnetic state in EuBaCo1.9O5.36 is shown to be caused by the structural distortions induced by vacancies in the cobalt and oxygen sublattices and by the frustration of AFM and FM exchange interactions.

A new parameter of the problem is the ratio of the sedimentation length to the vertical dimension of the cavity.

The introduction of magnetic field to the PLSM Lagrangian requires suitable utilization of Landau quantization, modification in the dispersion relations, and momentum-space dimension-reduction. We observed that increasing the magnetic field leads to filling-up lower Landau levels first and decreasing the number of occupied levels. We conclude that the population of Landau levels is most sensitive to the magnetic field and to the quark charges. The influences of finite magnetic field on the temperature dependence of chiral and deconfinement order-parameter(s) are studied. We present estimations for the magnetization, the magnetic susceptibility, the permeability, and the catalytic properties of QCD matter as functions of temperature. The dependences of the resulting freeze-out parameters, temperatures, and baryon chemical potentials on the corresponding magnetic field strengths have been analyzed, as well. These calculations are compared with recent lattice QCD simulations, whenever available. We conclude that the QCD matter seems to have paramagnetic property at temperatures greater than the critical one. There is an evidence for weak diamagnetic property at low temperatures.

The numerical simulations are carried out by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method applied to the equations of mechanics of deformable solids. Quantitative characteristics of the projectile fragmentation are obtained by studying statistics of the cloud of fragments. Considerable attention is given to scaling laws accompanying the fragmentation of the projectile. Scaling is carried out using the parameter K, which defines the number of the mesh cells in the projectile diameter. It is found that the dependence of the critical velocity Vc of fragmentation on the parameter K consists of two branches that correspond to two modes of the projectile fragmentation associated with the “small” and “large” aperture of the mesh cell. We obtain the dependences of the critical velocity Vc on the projectile diameter and the mesh parameters for both modes of the fragmentation. It is shown that the average cumulative mass distributions constructed at Vc exhibit the property of scale invariance, splitting into two groups of distributions corresponding exactly to the modes of the projectile fragmentation. In each group, the average cumulative distributions show good coincidence in the entire mass region; moreover, in the intermediate mass region, each group of distributions has a power-law distribution with an exponent τ different from that in the other group. Conclusions about the dependence of the exponent of the power-law distribution τ on the fragmentation mode are made.

The results show that the chiral symmetry restoration phase transition in the presence of the gauge boson mass ma is a typical second-order phase transition; the chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement phase transitions are coincident; the critical number of fermion flavors Nc f decreases as the gauge boson mass ma increases, which implies that there exists a boundary that separates the Nc f–ma plane into chiral symmetry breaking/confinement region for (Nc f, ma) below the boundary and chiral symmetry restoration/deconfinement region for (Nc f, ma) above it.

Two types of cation ordering are considered: simultaneous layered (LL) and checkerboard (RR) ordering of both cations. These two types of ordering are chosen due to their significance; namely, the ordering RR is one of the most implementable types of cation ordering in double perovskites, and compounds with layered ordering can be considered as a heterostructure consisting of periodically alternating metal–nonmagnetic metal layers, which is of interest for experimental synthesis and investigation. It is found that the type of cation ordering in compounds with T = Fe and Ni radically changes the magnetic and/or electronic properties of the compound. Moreover, it is found that low-symmetry stable phases are polar for both types of cation ordering, and the values of spontaneous polarization are evaluated.

The rotation angles of the director and the magnetization and the concentration of magnetic impurity corresponding to a supertwisted orientational structure of the suspension are calculated. It is shown that the deviation angle of the director from the direction of the external field has the hysteresis region in which the orientational structure of the FN changes stepwise from a state with a positive twist of the director to a state with a negative twist. A value of the magnetic field strength is found above which orientational bistability regions arise. It is shown that orientational instability under the rotation of the field most clearly manifests itself in FNs with strong anchoring of particles to the LC matrix. It is established that the effect of magnetic segregation responsible for the redistribution of magnetic particles in the layer leads to the expansion of the hysteresis region and to a decrease in the field at which orientational instability arises. It is shown that, in FNs with soft anchoring between magnetic and LC subsystems, there exist several response modes to a quasistatic rotation of the magnetic field.

The developed theory of reflectivity accounted for the magnetic contributions to the scattering amplitude predicts the appearance of a peak for the orthogonal (to the incident polarization) polarization of the reflected radiation near the critical angle of the total external reflection. The experiment reveals the significant difficulties because of the incomplete σ polarization of the synchrotron beam, the beam instability, and so on. Therefore, a rotated-polarization peak has been detected near the critical angle but at the limits of the measurement accuracy.

The long-range part in the pedestal region of the absorption band is associated with the distribution of molecules over the rotational states, and, in the range of wings of the absorption band, it is due to a finite time of collisions between emitting and perturbed molecules. The flux of resonant radiation produced by an excited atomic gas is estimated using the concepts of the spectral absorption band and a large optical thickness of the gas. These concepts are used for a molecular gas where, in the framework of the regular model (the Elsasser model), expressions are given for the absorption coefficient related to a specific spectral absorption band, separately in the pedestal region and for wings of the absorption band. As a demonstration of the possibilities of these concepts, the IR flux is calculated on the surface of Venus from its atmosphere, which includes seven vibrational transitions of the carbon dioxide molecule and amounts to 26% of the total flux of IR radiation emitted by the Venus surface. An analysis of the Venus energy balance leads to the conclusion that the main part of IR radiation of the Venus atmosphere falling on its surface is formed by a microscopic dust in the Venus atmosphere. This channel of the Venus energy balance is realized if the mass of a microscopic dust in the Venus atmosphere is seven orders of magnitude less than the mass of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

The cluster magnetism is found to be related to the presence of clusters of the following two types: large α-(Fe, Cr) clusters of size D = 150–250 Å and small (D = 40–80 Å) clusters in a random intercluster medium. The generation of small ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic clusters during ion irradiation leads to the formation of cluster glass, which affects the electrical properties of the alloy and causes a magnetic frustration. The temperature dependence of the barrier height is shown to characterize the magnetic state of the alloy in low fields. On the whole, the temperature dependence of the order parameter is a universal characteristic of the system. The temperature dependence of resistivity of initial alloys in the temperature range 98–300 K (ρ(T) ∝ T2) is determined by electron scattering by quantum defects, and the transition into a ferromagnetic state is revealed when the derivative ∂ρ/∂T ∝ T is analyzed. The increase in resistivity and the relation ρ ∝ T1/2 in strongly inhomogeneous samples after irradiation at a dose Φ = 1.5 × 1018 ions/cm2 are caused by weak localization effects, and the transition to a ferromagnetic state becomes obvious when the derivative ∂ρ/∂T ∝ T–1/2 is considered. Irradiation by fluence Φ = 3 × 1018 ions/cm2 induces a giant (twofold) increase in the alloy density, restores the ferromagnetism of large clusters, decreases the resistivity by 37%, and restores the relation ρ(T) ∝ T2, which results from the overlapping of the irradiation-induced small clusters when their concentration increases and from an increase in the alloy density. The overlapping of clusters lowers the barrier height and decreases the sensitivity of the alloy to an applied field. The relation ρ(T) ∝ T2 is valid for the entire temperature range T = 2–300 K because of the partial screening of the magnetic moments of large clusters by a medium having the properties of cluster glass.

The spectral dependences point to a mixed valence state of Mn and Pr in the films. It is found that, as compared to XANES, XMCD is more sensitive to the valence state of Pr4+. The field dependences of XMCD point to ferromagnetic behavior of Mn ions and the Van Vleck paramagnetism of Pr ions, which makes a significant contribution to the total magnetization of the films. It is shown that as the Sr concentration increases, the XMCD intensity at the K edge of Mn increases, which indicates a growth of the total magnetic moment of the film due to an increase in the 4p–3d hybridization.

The following features are revealed: formation of two-dimensional quantum-well states in the near-surface region, an increase in the binding energy of the Dirac cone and the core levels, and a simultaneous electronic states intensity redistribution in the system in photoemission spectra. The results obtained show that topological states may coexist at the interface between studied materials and a superconductor, which seems to be promising for application in quantum computers.

Glassy carbon samples before and after an explosive action are analyzed by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and electron-probe microanalysis. It is shown that as a result of microsecond shock pressure exposure, glassy carbon is compacted to ρCG ≈ 2.3(5) g/cm3 and is partly transformed into a graphite-like nanomaterial with a cellular structure. At the level of crystallites, the density of glassy carbon increases via a decrease in the interplanar spacings and an increase in the crystallite thickness and width. Spheres from 20 nm to 80 μm in diameter are found to be formed during shock-wave compression of glassy carbon in a copper container and high-temperature shock heating posteffects. Spheres 20 μm in diameter consist of a copper-rich core and a carbon shell.

In the case of a multisheet Fermi surface (FS), we calculate the dependence of the thermoelectric coefficients on the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the Lifshitz topological transition when the FS connectivity changes under the action of an external force (e.g., pressure) on the conductor. Upon a decrease in the spacing between individual pockets (sheets) of the FS, conduction electrons can tunnel as a result of the magnetic breakdown from one FS sheet to another; their motion over magneticbreakdown trajectories becomes complicated and entangled. The thermoelectric field exhibits a peculiar dependence on the magnetic field: for a noticeable deviation of vector B from the normal through angle ϑ to the layers, the thermoelectric field oscillates as a function of tanϑ. The period of these oscillations contains important information on the distance between individual FS sheets and their corrugation.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29592259@JETP

As the early Universe expands, the dimensionless quantity ν(n  F ) = P(n  F )/ε(n  F ) decreases with decreasing n  F  from its maximum value νmax = 1 for n  F  → ∞ to zero for n  F  → 0. The interaction of the scalar and gravitational fields, which is characterized by a dimensionless constant ξ, is proportional to the scalar curvature of four-dimensional space R = κ[3P(n  F )–ε(n  F )–4λ] (where κ is Einstein’s gravitational constant), and contains terms both quadratic and linear in φ. As a result, the expanding early Universe reaches the point of first-order phase transition in a finite time interval at critical values of the scalar curvature R = R  c  =–μ2/ξ and radius a  c  ≫ a 0. Thereafter, the early closed Universe “rolls down” from the flat inflection point of the potential U(φ) to the zero potential minimum in a finite time. The release of the total potential energy of the scalar field in the entire volume of the expanding Universe as it “rolls down” must be accompanied by the production of a large number of massive particles and antiparticles of various kinds, whose annihilation plays the role of the Big Bang.

As the result of emission of a laser pulse, the wave function of the atom varies with time; so, it is necessary to solve 1D time-dependent Schrödinger equation by means of split operator method. By illumination of a short duration, long wavelength three color laser pulse inside the gap, the enhanced field not only changes with time, but also varies in space. In this work we considered this space inhomogeneity in linear and nonlinear schemes. We show that in nonlinear case, the plateau region is more extended. We also show that in larger gaps, cutoff occurs on higher frequencies. But limitation of electron motion in bowtie nanostructures leads to the choice of an optimum 16 nm gap size in our case.

The linear independence of a set of coherent quasi-single-photon information states leads to the possibility of unambiguous measurements that, in the presence of losses in the line, restrict the transmission range of secret keys. Starting from a certain value of critical loss (the length of the line), the eavesdropper knows the entire key, does not make errors, and is not detected—the distribution of secret keys becomes impossible. This problem is solved by introducing an additional reference state with an average number of photons of μcl ≈ 103–106, depending on the length of the communication line. It is shown that the use of a reference state does not allow the eavesdropper to carry out measurements with conclusive outcome while remaining undetected. A reference state guarantees detecting an eavesdropper in a channel with high losses. In this case, information states may contain a mesoscopic average number of photons in the range of μ q  ≈ 0.5–102. The protocol proposed is easy to implement technically, admits flexible adjustment of parameters to the length of the communication line, and is simple and transparent for proving the secrecy of keys.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29492127@JETP

Main attention is paid to quantum well (QW) structures in which only QWs or both QW and barriers are doped (the doping level is assumed to be close to the value corresponding to the metal–insulator transition). The above factors include (i) ionization of localized states to the region of delocalized states above the mobility edge, which is presumed to exist in the impurity band; (ii) the coexistence in the upper and lower Hubbard bands (upon doping of QWs as well as barriers); in this case, in particular, the external magnetic field determines the relative contribution of the upper Hubbard band due to spin correlations at doubly filled sites; and (iii) the contribution of the exchange interaction at pairs of sites, in which the external magnetic field can affect the relation between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations. All these factors, which affect the structure and degree of disorder, lead to specific features in the temperature dependence of resistivity and determine specific features of the magnetoresistance.

The method is based on the interference approximation of the wave scattering theory and the hard disk model. Scattering from an individual liquid crystal droplet has been described using the anomalous diffraction approximation extended to the case of droplets with uniform and nonuniform interface anchoring at the droplet–polymer boundary. The director field structure in an individual droplet is determined from the solution of the problem of minimizing the volume density of the free energy. The electrooptical effect of symmetry breaking in the angular distribution of scattered radiation has been analyzed. This effect means that the intensities of radiation scattered within angles +θ s  and–θ s  relative to the direction of illumination in the scattering plane can be different. The effect is of the interference origin and is associated with asymmetry of the phase shift of the wavefront of an incident wave from individual parts of the droplet, which appears due to asymmetry of the director field structure in the droplet, caused by nonuniform anchoring of liquid crystal molecules with the polymer on its surface. This effect is analyzed in the case of normal illumination of the film depending on the interfacial anchoring at the liquid crystal–polymer interface, the orientation of the optical axes of droplets, their concentration, sizes, anisometry, and polydispersity.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29492130@JETP

We have conducted a detailed consideration of the case with η < 1/2, in which the perturbation theory is inapplicable, even for an arbitrarily weak interaction. It is shown that, in this case, reciprocal quantum time 1/τ q  is proportional to g 1/(1–η) T (2–η)/(2–2η), where g is the electron–phonon interaction constant and T is the temperature. The method developed here is applied for calculating the electron density of states in a magnetic field perpendicular to the membrane. In particular, it is shown that the Landau levels in the regime with ω c τ q  » 1 have a Gaussian shape with a width that depends on the magnetic field as B η. In addition, we calculate the time τφ of dephasing of the electron wave function that emerges due to the interaction with flexural phonons for η < 1/2. It has been shown that, in several temperature intervals, quantity 1/τφ can be expressed by various power functions of the electron–phonon interaction constant, temperature, and electron energy.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27578667@JETP

We propose a model for calculating the trajectories of charges particles in a high-voltage gas discharge in nitrogen at a pressure of 0.15 Torr existing in a nonuniform electrostatic field and the strength of this field. Based on the results of our calculations, we supplement and refine the extensive experimental data concerning the investigation of such a discharge published in [1, 2, 5–8]; good agreement between the theory and experiment has been achieved. The discharge burning is initiated and maintained through bulk electron-impact ionization and ion–electron emission. We have determined the sizes of the cathode surface regions responsible for these processes, including the sizes of the axial zone involved in the discharge generation. The main effect determining the kinetics of charged particles consists in a sharp decrease in the strength of the field under consideration outside the interelectrode space, which allows a free motion of charges with specific energies and trajectories to be generated in it. The simulation results confirm that complex electrode systems that allow directed plasma flows to be generated at a discharge current of hundreds or thousands of milliamperes and a voltage on the electrodes of 0.3–1 kV can be implemented in practice [3, 9, 10].@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29486482@JETP

The studies are performed over a wide pressure range up to 73 GPa using helium as a hydrostatic pressure-transferring medium. It is found that the quantum effects, which determine the difference between the ratio of the Raman scattering frequencies in the 12C and 13C diamonds and the classical ratio (1.0408), increase to 30 GPa and then decrease. Thus, inversion in the sign of the quantum contribution to the physical properties of diamond during compression is detected.

The possibility of emergence of nonphonon high-temperature superconductivity due to the predominance of electron–electron interband interactions over intraband interactions, as well as due to the fact that the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of multiband systems in the superconducting phase differ qualitatively from those of single-band systems, is indicated. Phase transitions in a quasi-2D anisotropic medium upon a change in the carrier concentration, i.e., a transition from the commensurate to the incommensurate state of the spin density wave, are analyzed. Such a transition is observed when the Umklapp processes in the lattice structure are taken into account. These processes facilitate a deviation of wavevector Q of the spin density wave from 2k  F , as well as a displacement of the bandgap relative to the Fermi surface. This leads to the generation of free charge carriers and the possibility of superconductivity. It is shown that superconductivity accompanies the magnetism.

Subsequently these atoms are transformed into solid nanoclusters, fractal aggregates and then into fractal fibers if the growth process proceeds in an external electric field. We are guided by metals in which transitions between s and d-electrons of their atoms are possible, since these metals are used as catalysts and filters in interaction with gas flows. The resistance of metal fractal structures to a gas flow is evaluated that allows one to find optimal parameters of a fractal structure for gas flow propagation through it. The thermal regime of interaction between a plasma pulse or a laser beam and a metal surface is analyzed. It is shown that the basic energy from an external source is consumed on a bulk metal heating, and the efficiency of atom evaporation from the metal surface, that is the ratio of energy fluxes for vaporization and heating, is 10–3–10–4 for transient metals under consideration. A typical energy flux (~106 W/cm2), a typical surface temperature (~3000 K), and a typical pulse duration (~1 μs) provide a sufficient amount of evaporated atoms to generate fractal fibers such that each molecule of a gas flow collides with the skeleton of fractal fibers many times.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29473357@JETP

The thickness of the Ge x Si1–x  buffer layer is 7–35 nm.

It is analytically and numerically shows that the type of avalanche dynamics in the system changes as a function of these parameters. The following three regimes can take place in the system: (1) avalanches of any sizes, from small to catastrophic, can appear, which is reflected in the power-law behavior of the probability density function of the appearance of avalanches of certain sizes; (2) avalanches of a certain average size mainly appear in the system, and the probability density is close to that of a normal distribution; and (3) transient regime, where the probability density function of the appearance of avalanches of certain sizes is close to an exponential function.

Calculations have been performed for three systems: (i) the model without a soft-magnetic layer (hard-magnetic layer), (ii) the model with a soft-magnetic layer of thickness 25 atomic layers (predominantly exchange-coupled system), and (iii) with 50 (weak exchange coupling) atomic layers. The effect of a soft-magnetic phase on the magnetization reversal of the magnetic bilayer and on the formation of a 1D spin spring in the magnetic bilayer has been demonstrated. An inf lection that has been detected on the arch of the hysteresis loop only for the system with weak exchange coupling is completely determined by the behavior of the soft layer in the external magnetic field.

It is found that for a certain relation between the depths of shallow and deep wells in this set, conditions are realized under which the exciton channel in the luminescence excitation spectrum of a shallow well dominates in the region of kinetic exciton energies exceeding 10 longitudinal optical phonons above the bottom of the exciton band of the ZnSe barrier. A model is developed for the transfer of electrons, holes, and excitons between the electronic states of shallow and deep quantum wells separated by wide enough barriers. It is shown that the most probable process of electronic energy transfer between the states of shallow and deep quantum wells is indirect tunneling with the simultaneous excitation of a longitudinal optical phonon in the lattice. Because the probability of this process for single charge carriers considerably exceeds the exciton tunneling probability, a system of double quantum wells can be prepared in which, in the case of weak enough excitation, the states of quantum dots in shallow quantum wells will be mainly populated by excitons, which explains experimental results obtained.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31031084@JETP

The substitution of cobalt ions for manganese ions is shown to decrease the magnetization and the Curie temperature from 270 K (x = 0.13) to 140 K (x = 0.33). As the cobalt ion content increases to x = 0.5, the Curie temperature increases to 190 K, the magnetization decreases, and the electrical resistivity increases. At x > 0.5, the temperature of transition into a paramagnetic state decreases to 68 K (x = 0.8) and then again increases to 225 K for the La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 composition. The magnetoresistive effect in the range 0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.4 reaches 97% and decreases gradually with increasing temperature without anomalies near the Curie point. At x ≤ 0.2, the magnetoresistive effect increases near the Curie temperature. The composition at x = 0.6 is stoichiometric, and no coherent magnetic contribution to neutron scattering is detected.

The thermodynamics leads to an exact cancellation of the quantum-field zero-point-energies in equilibrium, which partly solves the main cosmological constant problem. But, with reversible dynamics, the spatially flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker universe asymptotically approaches the Minkowski vacuum only if the Big Bang already started out in an initial equilibrium state. Here, we extend q-theory by introducing dissipation from irreversible processes. Neglecting the possible instability of a de-Sitter vacuum, we obtain different scenarios with either a de-Sitter asymptote or collapse to a final singularity. The Minkowski asymptote still requires fine-tuning of the initial conditions. This suggests that, within the q-theory approach, the decay of the de-Sitter vacuum is a necessary condition for the dynamical solution of the cosmological constant problem.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31059013@JETP

The systematization of transport regimes depends on the relation between the time t 0 of emergence of impurity from the barrier and time t * corresponding to the beginning of degradation. For t 0 < t *, degradation processes are immaterial. In the opposite situation, when t 0 > t *, the results on time intervals t < t * can be formally reduced to the problem with a stationary barrier. The characteristics of regimes with t * < t < t 0 depend on the scenario of barrier degradation. For an exponentially fast scenario, the interval t * < t < t 0 is very narrow, and the transport regime occurring over time intervals t < t * passes almost jumpwise to the regime of the problem without a barrier. In the slow power-law scenario, the transport over long time interval t * < t < t 0 occurs in a new regime, which is faster as compared to the problem with a stationary barrier, but slower than in the problem without a barrier. The asymptotic form of the concentration at large distances from the source over time intervals t < t 0 has two steps, while for t > t 0, it has only one step. The more remote step for t < t 0 and the single step for t > t 0 coincide with the asymptotic form in the problem without a barrier.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31054539@JETP

Under these conditions, the trapping time may increase by tens of times. Magnetic field enhances the effect of quantum beats observed on time scales commensurate with the lifetime of the excited states of atoms.

The glasses exhibit elastic behavior in compression only at a pressure up to 1 GPa, and a diffuse structural transformation and inelastic density relaxation (logarithmic in time) begin at higher pressures. When the pressure increases further, the relaxation rate passes through a sharp maximum at 2.5 GPa, which is accompanied by softening the relaxing bulk modulus, and then decreases, being noticeable up to the maximum pressure. When pressure is relieved, an unusual inflection point is observed in the baric dependence of the bulk modulus near 4 GPa. The polyamorphic transformation is only partly reversible and the residual densification after pressure release is 2%. In compression, the electrical resistivity of the g-As2Te3 glasses decreases exponentially with increasing pressure (at a pressure up to 2 GPa); then, it decreases faster by almost three orders of magnitude in the pressure range 2–3.5 GPa. At a pressure of 5 GPa, the electrical resistivity reaches 10–3 Ω cm, which is characteristic of a metallic state; this resistivity continues to decrease with increasing pressure and reaches 1.7 × 10–4 Ω cm at 8.1 GPa. The reverse metal–semiconductor transition occurs at a pressure of 3 GPa when pressure is relieved. When the pressure is decreased to atmospheric pressure, the electrical resistivity of the glasses is below the initial pressure by two–three orders of magnitude. Under normal conditions, both the volume and the electrical resistivity relax to quasi-equilibrium values in several months. Comparative structural and Raman spectroscopy investigations demonstrate that the glasses subjected to high pressure have the maximum chemical order. The glasses with a higher order have a lower electrical resistivity. The polyamorphism in the As2Te3 glasses is caused by both structural changes and chemical ordering. The g-As2Te3 compound is the first example of glasses, where the reversible metallization under pressure has been studied under hydrostatic conditions.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31127577@JETP

The nonresonance of the structure is determined by the fact that the level of the ground state of the magnetic layer falls into the range of the excited states of the nonmagnetic QW. The electron polarization in the ground thermalized state of QW is found not to depend on the magnetic part of the structure. However, the magnetic part affects the electron polarization in the excited state via spin injection from the magnetic semiconductor and the mixing of the electronic states of the magnetic and nonmagnetic subsystems of the structure. The possibility of controlling the polarization of an electron spin by carrier excitation toward the region of mixed states along with the absence of depolarizing influence of the magnetic semiconductor on carriers in the thermalized state of QW can be applied to design new spintronic devices along with those that use spin injection, optical orientation, and depolarization.

This analysis completes the series of works based on NT200 data in the search for a dark matter annihilation signal in astrophysical objects. We have found no significant excess in the number of observed events relative to the expected background from atmospheric neutrinos in all tested directions, in 22 dSphs and the LMC. For a sample of five selected dwarf galaxies we have performed a joint analysis of the data by the maximum likelihood method.

In this description, the r parameter measures the ratio of occupation numbers of gravitons versus inflatons, which, according to BICEP2, was roughly a half at the time of 60 e-foldings prior to the end of inflation. We stress that in a non-Wilsonian UV self-completion of gravity, any trans-Planckian mode coupled to the inflaton is a black hole.

Calculations of the dependence of the photoionization cross section on the photon energy were performed within the Random Phase Approximation with Exchange for outer subshells (RPAE) and within the Generalized Random Phase Approximation with Exchange (GRPAE) for inner subshells. The latter theoretical approach includes both many-electron correlations and core rearrangement due to escape of one of the electrons from the system. The results of calculations for the negative sodium ion were found to be in good agreement with experimental data. Better agreement was achieved by allowing dynamical polarization of the electron core. It manifests itself as a many-electron response to variation of the external electromagnetic field, which results from the excitation of the many-electron system. Detailed study of the main mechanisms determining the cross section dependence profile was carried out. These mechanisms are the inter- and intrachannel correlations acting as a many-electron response to the external field, the electron core rearrangement, and the dynamic polarization. Besides sodium and potassium ions, photoionization of rubidium ion was investigated.

Bulk freeze-out properties in terms of the thermal parameters, temperature and mid-rapidity baryon chemical potential at chemical freeze-out, obtained within the proposed model, which are in agreement with experimental data. The extracted chemical freeze-out temperature is found to depend weakly on the collision centrality. It is also found that this temperature is almost independent of the collision energies considered in this work. The closeness of the freeze-out temperature to the predicted phase-transition temperature suggests that the chemical freeze-out happens near hadronization. Furthermore, the dependence of the mid-rapidity chemical potential on the collision energy at different centralities, as well as the centrality dependence of the mid-rapidity size of the system in terms of the transverse size of the system, has been studied at the RHIC.

A system of self-consistent equations for the matrix Green’s function and matrix vertex function is derived. On the basis of this matrix generalization of the new self-consistent approximation, a theory of magnetoelastic resonance is developed for a ferromagnetic model, where the magnetoelastic coupling parameter ε(x) is inhomogeneous. Equations for magnetoelastic resonance are analyzed for one-dimensional inhomogeneities of the coupling parameter. The diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the matrix Green’s function of the system of coupled spin and elastic waves are calculated with the change in the ratio between the average value ε and rms fluctuation Δε of the coupling parameter between waves from the homogeneous case (ε ≠ 0, Δε = 0) to the extremely randomized case (ε = 0, Δε ≠ 0) at various correlation wavenumbers of inhomogeneities k c. For the limiting case of infinite correlation radius (k c = 0), in addition to approximate expressions, exact analytical expressions corresponding to the summation of all diagrams of elements of the matrix Green’s function are obtained. The results calculated for an arbitrary k c value in the new self-consistent approximation are compared to the results obtained in the standard self-consistent approximation, where only the first term of the expansion of the vertex function is taken into account. It is shown that the new approximation corrects disadvantages of the Green’s functions calculated in the standard approximation such as the dome shape of resonances and bends on the sides of resonance peaks. The appearance of a fine structure of the spectrum in the form of a narrow resonance on the Green’s function of spin waves and a narrow antiresonance on the Green’s function of elastic waves, which was previously predicted in the standard self-consistent approximation, is confirmed. With an increase in the parameter k c, the Green’s functions calculated in the standard and new approximations approach each other and almost coincide with each other at k c/k ≥ 0.5. At the same time, the results of this work indicate that the new self-consistent approximation has a certain advantage for studying the problems of stochastic radiophysics in media with long-wavelength inhomogeneities (small k c values), because it describes both the shape and width of peaks much better than the standard approximation.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31076632@JETP

The thermodynamic functions have been calculated for the first time within the “3+” model for a plasma fluid. The magnification and compensation of intercharge and interatomic interactions when calculating the equation of state and composition are analyzed. The introduction of the jellium leads to an increase in conductivity under compression, while the compensation of interactions when calculating the composition leads to a virtually ideal-gas behavior of the equation of state. Comparison with the data from physical and numerical experiments has confirmed our conclusions and demonstrated that the hypothesis about jellium, a new gas–plasma component, is constructive.

The measured temperature dependences of the heat capacity of polycrystalline ordered and disordered samples and a single-crystal ordered Gd0.4Sr0.6CoO2.85 sample exhibit two Schottky anomalies. These anomalies are thought to be related to the high-spin state of the Co3+ ions in the pyramidal environment caused by oxygen deficiency and to the magnetic state of oxygen p electrons induced by the doping-assisted generation of a hole in the 2p state. The absence of a noticeable shift in the absorption edge and the presence of two Schottky anomalies support the fact that the charge state of cobalt remains unchanged in the compounds under study.

The correlation of ions is taken into account using the Ornstein–Zernike integral equation in the hypernetted-chain approximation. It is found that the effect of ion correlation in a nondegenerate plasma is weak, while in a degenerate plasma, this effect must be taken into account when screening is determined by the electron component alone. The calculated values of the electrical conductivity of a hydrogen plasma are compared with the values determined experimentally in the megabar pressure range.

A comparison of experimental data with numerical calculations showed that the changes observed in experiments are not explained by the temperature dependence of the parameters of elements of a nanoparticle.

The growth of coupling strength leads to the rapid growth of Hc2(T), especially at low temperatures. In BEC limit and in the region of BCS–BEC crossover Hc2(T), dependence becomes practically linear. Disordering also leads to the general growth of Hc2(T). In BCS limit of weak coupling increasing disorder lead both to the growth of the slope of the upper critical field in the vicinity of the transition point and to the increase of Hc2(T) in the low temperature region. In the limit of strong disorder in the vicinity of the Anderson transition localization corrections lead to the additional growth of Hc2(T) at low temperatures, so that the Hc2(T) dependence becomes concave. In BCS–BEC crossover region and in BEC limit disorder only slightly influences the slope of the upper critical field close to Tc. However, in the low temperature region Hc2 (T may significantly grow with disorder in the vicinity of the Anderson transition, where localization corrections notably increase Hc2 (T = 0) also making Hc2(T) dependence concave.

For = 0, examples of stable solutions of type Wn = θn(t)exp(–iωt) with a nontrivial topology are found numerically for P = 3. In addition, the dynamics of various unsteady knots with P = 3 is modeled, and the tendency to the formation of a singularity over a finite time interval is observed in some cases. For P = 2 and small ≠ 0, configurations of type W0–W1 ≈ B0exp(iζ) + C(B0, α)exp(–iζ) + D(B0, α)exp(3iζ), where B0 > 0 is an arbitrary constant, ζ = k0 0t + ζ0, k0 = Q/2, and Ω0 = (–α)/2–2/B0 2, which rotate about the z axis, are investigated. Wide stability regions for such solutions are detected in the space of parameters (α, B0). In unstable zones, a vortex knot may return to a weakly excited state.

The spectrum of subgap quasiparticle excitations in two- and three-quantum vortices trapped by a cylindrical cavity has been calculated in the quasiclassical approximation. It is shown that the transformation of the spectrum is accompanied by break of anomalous spectral branches due to normal reflection of quasiparticles from the surface of a defect. A microscopic (spectral) criterion for multiquantum vortex pinning has been proposed; according to this criterion, the multiquantum vortex can be trapped in the cavity during the formation of a minigap in the elementary excitation spectrum near the Fermi level. Self-consistent calculations of density of states N(r, ε) for two- and three-quantum vortices trapped by a cylindrical cavity of radius on the order of ξ0 have been performed using quasiclassical Eilenberger equations. In the pure limit and for low temperatures T ≪ Tc, peculiarities observed in the N(r, ε) distribution reflect the presence of M anomalous spectral branches in the M-quantum vortex and confirm the correctness of the spectral criterion of pinning (depinning) of a multiquantum vortex.

The relaxation is shown to be substantial only in thin films. The magnetization relaxation is found to be well described by the sum of two exponential functions with characteristic times that differ by an order of magnitude from each other. The characteristic relaxation time and the ratio of the contributions of two relaxations depend on temperature. The activation energies of the relaxation processes are determined. The activation volume is shown to correspond to a 20-nm ferromagnetic cluster. The results obtained agree with the model of two-component magnetization in thin PdFe films [6].

The analysis of this equation yields six branches in the excitation spectrum of this magnet. It is important that the crystal field for ions with spin S = 2 is described by the Hamiltonian of single-ion easy-plane anisotropy, whose orientation is changed by 90° when passing from one HS iron ion to another. The U(N) transformation technique in the atomic representation is applied to diagonalize a single-ion Hamiltonian with a large number of levels. It is shown that the modulation of the orientation of easy magnetization planes leads to a model of a ferrimagnet with easy-axis anisotropy and to the formation of energy spectrum with a large gap. For HS iron ions, a decrease in the mean value of the spin projection due to quantum fluctuations is calculated. The analysis of the specific features of the spectrum of elementary excitations allows one to establish a correspondence to a generalized Ising model for which the magnetic susceptibility is calculated in a wide range of temperatures by the transfer-matrix method.

For this purpose, an asymptotic theory describing the dynamics of such 2D soliton-like formations in an arbitrary smoothly nonuniform flow of a ultracold Bose gas is developed. Disregarding the radiation loss associated with acoustic wave emission, we demonstrate that vortex–antivortex pairs can be put in correspondence with quasiparticles, and their behavior can be described by canonical Hamilton equations. For these equations, we determine the integrals of motion that can be used to classify various regimes of scattering of vortex pairs by a single quantum vortex.

2016@Тимонин П Н|@Thermodynamics dilute chain field@0@Gapless phases in ground states of low-dimensional quantum spin systems are rather ubiquitous. Their peculiarity is a remarkable sensitivity to external perturbations due to permanent criticality of such phases manifested by a slow (power-low) decay of pair correlations and the divergence of the corresponding susceptibility. A strong influence of various defects on the properties of the system in such a phase can then be expected. Here, we consider the influence of vacancies on the thermodynamics of the simplest quantum model with a gapless phase, the isotropic spin-1/2 XX chain. The existence of the exact solution of this model gives a unique opportunity to describe in detail the dramatic effect of dilution on the gapless phase—the appearance of an infinite series of quantum phase transitions resulting from level crossing under the variation of a longitudinal magnetic field. We calculate the jumps in the field dependences of the ground-state longitudinal magnetization, susceptibility, entropy, and specific heat appearing at these transitions and show that they result in a highly nonlinear temperature dependence of these parameters at low T. Also, the effect of enhancement of the magnetization and longitudinal correlations in the dilute chain is established. The changes of the pair spin correlators under dilution are also analyzed. The universality of the mechanism of the quantum transition generation suggests that similar effects of dilution can also be expected in gapless phases of other low-dimensional quantum spin systems.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27093815@JETP

The idea of “polar catastrophe,” which was successfully used earlier to explain the electronic properties of the interface between two perovskites LaAlO3/SrTiO3, is chosen as a base hypothesis. Piezoelectric response microscopy is used to reveal the presence of spontaneous polarization on the surface of a polymer film, and the remanent polarization is found to decrease with increasing film thickness. As in the case of perovskites, the polymer film thickness is found to strongly affect the electrical conductivity along the interface. Substantial differences between these phenomena are detected. The change in the electrical conductivity is shown to be caused by a significant increase in the charge carrier mobility when the film thickness decreases below a certain critical value. The relation between the change in the carrier mobility and the change in the spontaneous surface polarization of the polymer film when its thickness decreases is discussed.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27141603@JETP

Various gas forms exist inside the liquid: dissolved gas molecules attached to solvent molecules, free gas molecules, and gaseous bubbles. Thermodynamic equilibrium is maintained between two phases; the first phase is the liquid containing dissolved and free molecules, and the second phase is the gas over the liquid and bubbles inside it. Kinetics of gas transition between the internal and external gas proceeds through bubbles and includes the processes of bubbles floating up and bubble growth as a result of association due to the Smoluchowski mechanism. Evolution of a gas in the liquid is considered using the example of oxygen in water, and numerical parameters of this system are given. In the regime under consideration for an oxygen–water system, transport of oxygen into the surrounding air proceeds through micron-size bubbles with lifetimes of hours.

We observe three different regimes of motion (stationary, periodic, and turbulent regimes), each of which is realized in a certain range of fields oriented along the easy magnetization axis.

In particular, the influence of temperature on the radiationless decay during the relaxation of an exciton spin into the ground state of a Hall insulator at a filling factor ν = 2 is studied. The generation of photoexcited electrons and holes is controlled using photoinduced resonance reflection spectra, which makes it possible to estimate the density of light-generated electron–hole pairs and to independently control the self-consistent generation of electrons at the first Landau level and holes (vacancies) at the ground (zero) cyclotron electronic level. The existence of triplet excitons is established from inelastic light scattering spectra, which are used to determine the singlet–triplet exciton splitting. The lifetimes of triplet excitons, which are closely related to the relaxation time of an electron spin, are extremely long: they reach 100 μs in perfect GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures with a high mobility of two-dimensional electrons at low temperatures. These long spin relaxation times are qualitatively explained, and the expected collective behavior of high-density triplet magnetoexcitons at sufficiently low temperatures, which is related to their Bose nature, is discussed.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27159848@JETP

This is compatible with the well-known GZK cutoff [7, 8] at γ ≈ 1011. We have obtained the condition γ > γth ≈ 2.1 × 102 for the appearance of VCR when a sufficiently fast charged particle (an electron, a proton, or a nucleus) passes through intense laser radiation. This condition ensures that VCR can be observed experimentally (e.g., on the Large Hadron Collider) without invoking any additional conditions required from the currently existing estimate of γth > 8.8 × 104 [13] based on the now universally accepted quantum theory of VCR, which follows from Minkowski’s theory (and which gives an estimate of γ > 1021 when excited by the relic photon gas).@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27141443@JETP

The limit of small electron energies e for the electron attachment cross section at room vibrational temperature takes place at ε ≪ 2 meV, while in the range 2 meV ≪ ε ≪ 80 meV, the cross section is inversely proportional to ε.

It has a sharp maximum for V near v  nF/2, where n is the number of the uppermost electron miniband (channel) taking part in conduction and v  nF is the corresponding Fermi velocity. This means that the phenomenon of ion beam drag can be used for investigation of the electron spectra of ballistic nanostructures. We note that whereas observation of the Coulomb drag between two parallel quantum wires may in general be complicated by phenomena such as tunneling and phonon drag, the Coulomb drag of electrons of a one-dimensional ballistic nanowire by an ion beam is free of such spurious effects.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26853553@JETP

The hydrodynamic equations are solved by expanding the Hamiltonian in a small parameter. The equations for three interacting waves, one of which is unstable, have been derived and solved numerically. The three-wave interaction is shown to stabilize the instability. Various regimes of the system’s dynamics, including the stochastic ones dependent on one of the invariants in the problem, can arise in this case. It is pointed out that the instability development scenario considered differs from the previously considered scenario of a different type, where the three-wave interaction does not stabilize the instability.

They are characterized by a topological Hopf number. We investigate the dependence of the ADM masses of gravitating Hopfions on the gravitational coupling. When gravity is coupled to flat space solutions, a branch of gravitating Hopfion solutions arises and merges at a maximal value of the coupling constant with a second branch of solutions. This upper branch has no flat space limit. Instead, in the limit of a vanishing coupling constant, it connects to either the Bartnik–McKinnon or a generalized Bartnik–McKinnon solution. We further find that in the strong-coupling limit, there is no difference between the gravitating solitons of the Skyrme model and the Faddeev–Skyrme model.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26854476@JETP

A theoretical model for the formation and propagation of shock waves has been proposed on the basis of the analysis of the energy released by a proton beam in the electronic subsystem of the material owing to the deceleration of secondary particles appearing in nuclear reactions induced by this beam on the electronic subsystem of the material. The subsequent transfer of the energy from the excited electronic subsystem to the crystal lattice through the electron-phonon interaction has been described within the thermal spike model [I.M. Lifshitz, M.I. Kaganov, and L.V. Tanatarov, Sov. Phys. JETP 4, 173 (1957); I.M. Lifshitz, M.I. Kaganov, and L.V. Tanatarov, At. Energ. 6, 391 (1959); K. Yasui, Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res., Sect. B 90, 409 (1994)]. The model of the formation of shock waves involves energy exchange processes between excited electronic and ionic subsystems of the irradiated material and is based on the hydrodynamic approximation proposed by Zel’dovich [Ya.B. Zel’dovich and Yu.P. Raizer, Physics of Shock Waves and High-Temperature Hydrodynamic Phenomena (Nauka, Moscow, 1966; Dover, New York, 2002)]. This model makes it possible to obtain the space-time distributions of the main physical characteristics (temperatures of the ionic and electronic subsystems, density, pressure, etc.) in materials irradiated by high-energy proton beams and to analyze the formation and propagation of shock waves in them. The nonlinear differential equations describing the conservation laws of mass, energy, and momentum of electrons and ions in the Euler variables in the case of the propagation of shock waves has been solved with the Godunov scheme [S. K. Godunov, A.V. Zabrodin, M.Ya. Ivanov, A.N. Kraiko, and G.P. Prokopov, Numerical Solution of Multidimensional Problems in Gas Dynamics (Nauka, Moscow, 1976) [in Russian]]. The temperature, pressure, and specific internal energy have been calculated independently and separately for the ionic and electronic subsystems of the irradiated material. The formation of shock waves in copper has been simulated in the cylindrical geometry for various sizes and various types of the beam: for a needle beam (the distribution of protons in the beam is described by the Dirac delta function) and beams with a finite radius (0.3, 3, and 5 mm) with a Gaussian distribution of protons near the axis of the beam. The effect of the size and geometry of the proton beam, as well as of the form of the chosen boundary conditions, on the intensity of shock waves formed in copper and on change in their physicomechanical properties in the space and time has been revealed in the numerical simulation results.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=21870362@JETP

We find a notable increase in the surface local density of states (LDOS) around the surface dopant near the bottom of the empty surface state band π*, which we call a split state due to its limited spatial extent and energetic position inside the band gap. We show that despite the well-established bulk donor impurity energy level position at the very bottom of the conduction band, a surface donor impurity on the Ge(111)-(2 × 1) surface might produce an energy level below the Fermi energy, depending on the impurity atom local environment. It is demonstrated that the impurity located in subsurface atomic layers is visible in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) experiment on the Ge(111)-(2 × 1) surface. The quasi-1D character of the impurity image, observed in STM experiments, is confirmed by our computer simulations with a note that a few π-bonded dimer rows may be affected by the presence of the impurity atom.

2014@Рубцов Г И|Троицкий С В|@Breaks gamma-ray spectra distant blazars transparency Universe@24@Energetic gamma rays scatter on soft background radiation when propagating through the Universe, producing electron-positron pairs (A.I. Nikishov, Sov. Phys. JETP 14, 393 (1962)). Gamma rays with energies between 100 GeV and a few TeV interact mostly with infrared background photons whose amount is poorly known experimentally but safely constrained from below by account of the contribution of observed light from known galaxies (R.C. Keenan, A.J. Barger, L.L. Cowie, and W.-H. Wang, Astrophys. J. 723, 40 (2010); arXiv: 1102.2428). The expected opacity of the intergalactic space limits the mean free path of TeV gamma rays to dozens of Megaparsecs. However, TeV photons from numerous more distant sources have been detected (S.P. Wakely and D. Horan, http://tevcat.uchicago.edu/). This might be interpreted, in each particular case, in terms of hardening of the emitted spectrum caused by presently unknown mechanisms at work in the sources (S. Archambault et al. (VERITAS and Fermi LAT Collaborations), Astrophys. J. 785, L16 (2014); arXiv: 1403.4308). Here we show that this interpretation is not supported by the analysis of the ensemble of all observed sources. In the frameworks of an infrared-background model with the lowest opacity (R.C. Gilmore, R.S. Somerville, J.R. Primack, and A. Dominguez, Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc. 422, 3189 (2012); arXiv: 1104.0671), we reconstruct the emitted spectra of distant blazars and find that upward spectral breaks appear precisely at those energies where absorption effects are essential. Since these energies are very different for similar sources located at various distances, we conclude that the breaks are artefacts of the incorrect account of absorption and, therefore, the opacity of the Universe for gamma rays is overestimated even in the most conservative model. This implies that some novel physical or astrophysical phenomena should affect long-distance propagation of gamma rays. A scenario in which a part of energetic photons is converted to an inert new particle in the vicinity of the source and reconverts back close to the observer (M. Simet, D. Hooper, and P. Serpico, Phys. Rev. D 77, 063001 (2008); arXiv: 0712.2825; M. Fairbairn, T. Rashba, and S. Troitsky, Phys. Rev. D 84, 125019 (2011); arXiv:0901.4085) does not contradict our results.

Here we calculate the anomalous Hall conductivity of a Weyl semimetal with a tilted conical spectrum for a pair of Weyl points, using the Kubo formula. We find that the Hall conductivity is not universal and can change sign as a function of the parameters quantifying the tilts. Our results suggest that even for the case where the separation between the Weyl points vanishes, tilting of the conical spectrum could give rise to a finite anomalous Hall effect, if the tilts of the two cones are not identical.

The action of a laser results in the melting of the film in the region of a laser spot and in its thermomechanical separation from the substrate. The separated film acquires a dome shape because of a decrease in the temperature in the direction from the center of the laser spot. This theoretical model provides the explanation of the formation of nanodroplets. It has been established that, first, the separation speed of a gold film from glass decreases sharply because the acoustic impedance of gold is much larger than that of glass. Second, nanodroplets are formed owing to the capillary focusing of the substance, which is manifested in the appearance of the drag component directed toward the axis of symmetry of the dome. The surface tension becomes dynamically significant because of the indicated sharp decrease in the separation speed from glass and of the smallness of the diameter of the focal spot (D ∼ 1 μm), which is determined by the diffraction limit of optical radiation.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23994827@JETP_LETTERS

This value is an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding change measured at 1.6 T.

In the present paper we report the results of transport measurements in this quantum well under hydrostatic pressure of 14.4 kbar. By applying pressure we have further reduced the band overlap, thereby creating favorable conditions for the formation of the excitonic insulator state. As a result, we observed that the metallic-like temperature dependence of the conductivity at lowering temperature sharply changes to the activated behavior, signaling the onset of an excitonic insulator regime.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=21866014@JETP_LETTERS

Their anisotropic magnetic and magnetoelectric properties have been studied at temperatures of 2–360 K in magnetic fields up to 200 kOe. In all compounds under study, a spontaneous transition from the collinear ferrimagnetic uniaxial phase to a conical structure has been detected with a decrease in the temperature at a temperature increasing with the concentration of Sc up to room temperature. In magnetic fields both parallel and perpendicular to the c axis, the conical phase is suppressed and the transition to the collinear ferrimagnetic structure occurs. Phase diagrams have been plotted in H-T coordinates. In conical magnetic structures, a magnetic-field-induced electric polarization (higher than 40 μC/m2 at 4 K) has been detected in the geometry corresponding to the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction mechanism (spin current). A higher stability of the polar state with respect to magnetic fields (higher than 50 kOe) and temperatures (up to 100 K) has been revealed as compared to previous studies of the Ba system.

The interfacial spin splitting has been shown to compensate (enhance) considerably the contribution of the bulk Dresselhaus (Bychkov-Rashba) mechanism. The theoretical approach is based on the solution of the effective mass equation in a quasi-triangular well supplemented by a new boundary condition at a high and atomically sharp hetero-barrier. The model takes into account the spin-orbit interaction of electrons with both bulk and interfacial crystal potential having C 2v  symmetry, as well as the lack of inversion symmetry and nonparabolicity of the conduction band in GaAs. The effective 2D spin Hamiltonian including both bulk and interface contributions to the Dresselhaus (αBIA) and Rashba (αSIA) constants has been derived. The analytical relation between these constants and the components of the anisotropic nonlinear g-factor tensor in an oblique quantizing magnetic field has been found.

When the wavelength of radiation of the dye laser is tuned to absorption lines of molecular iodine vapor in a cell in the cavity, short pulses following with a period equal to or multiple of the round-trip time of light around the cavity appear. The duration of the generated pulses is about 1 ns, which is much shorter than the phase memory time in iodine vapor. In such a situation, modelocking occurs owing to the coherent character of the interaction of laser radiation with narrow absorption resonances in molecular iodine vapor.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23993647@JETP_LETTERS

The interface is realized as a tunnel NbN side contact to a narrow 8-nm HgTe quantum well. It demonstrates a typical Andreev behavior with finite conductance within the superconducting gap. Surprisingly, the conductance is modulated by a number of equally-spaced oscillations. The oscillations are present only within the superconducting gap and at lowest, below 1 K, temperatures. The oscillations disappear completely in magnetic fields, normal to the two-dimensional electron system plane. In contrast, the period of the oscillations is only weakly affected by the highest, up to 14 T, in-plane oriented magnetic fields.

Stokes wave is the fully nonlinear gravity wave propagating with the constant velocity. The increase in the scaled wave height H/λ from the linear limit H/λ = 0 to the critical value H max/λ marks the transition from the limit of almost linear wave to a strongly nonlinear limiting Stokes wave. Here, H is the wave height and λ is the wavelength. We simulated fully nonlinear Euler equations, reformulated in terms of conformal variables, to find Stokes waves for different wave heights. Analyzing spectra of these solutions we found in conformal variables, at each Stokes wave height, the distance ν  c  from the lowest singularity in the upper half-plane to the real line which corresponds to the fluid free surface. We also identified that this singularity is the square-root branch point. The limiting Stokes wave emerges as the singularity reaches the fluid surface.

For increasing laser pulse width τlas < 3 ps, a drastic (threefold) drop of the ablation threshold of aluminum has been observed for visible pulses compared to an almost negligible threshold variation for IR pulses. In contrast, the ablation threshold in silicon increases threefold with increasing τlas for IR pulses, while the corresponding thresholds for visible pulses remained almost constant. In aluminum, such a width-dependent decrease in ablation thresholds has been related to strongly diminished temperature gradients for pulse widths exceeding the characteristic electron-phonon thermalization time. In silicon, the observed increase in ablation thresholds has been ascribed to two-photon IR excitation, while in the visible range linear absorption of the material results in almost constant thresholds.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27141346@JETP_LETTERS

The large contributions of vacuum fluctuations to the surface tension of this film are cancelled in equilibrium by the thermodynamic potential arising from the conservation law for particle number. In short, the surface tension of the film vanishes in equilibrium due to a thermodynamic identity. This 2D brane can be generalized to a 4D brane with gravity. For the 4D brane, the analogue of the 2D surface tension is the 4D cosmological constant, which is also nullified in full equilibrium. The 4D brane theory provides an alternative description of the phenomenological q-theory of the quantum vacuum. As for other realizations of the vacuum variable q, such as the 4-form field-strength realization, the main ingredient is the conservation law for the variable q, which makes the vacuum a self-sustained system. For a vacuum within this class, the nullification of the cosmological constant takes place automatically in equilibrium. Out of equilibrium, the cosmological constant can be as large as suggested by naive estimates based on the summation of zero-point energies. In this brane description, q-theory also corresponds to a generalization of unimodular gravity.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27134942@JETP_LETTERS

It is shown that, because of the behavior of the nanocell as a low-Q-factor Fabry–Pérot etalon, the sign of the derivative of the selective reflection spectra changes near L ≈ λ/2 from negative at L > λ/2 to positive at L < λ/2. The simplicity of the experimental implementation, large amplitude, and sub-Doppler width (40MHz) of a detected signal at an atomic transition frequency are appropriate for applications in metrology and magnetometry. In particular, selective reflection from the nanocell is a convenient frequency marker of atomic transitions; in this case, the amplitudes of peaks are proportional to the transition probabilities.

The analytical solution of the problem has been found under the conditions of a strongly nonstationary process and large deviations from equilibrium. It has been shown that the previous solutions found in the quasi-steady-state approximation are the special cases of the solution found in this work. It has been demonstrated that the equilibrium is achieved at the crystallization front after some time if the initial supercooling is below the thermal effect of the phase transition (the Kutateladze criterion is greater than unity). In this case, the solution of the problem becomes self-similar. The crystal grows all the time under essentially nonequilibrium conditions if the initial supercooling is above the critical one.

The matrix e α μ can be naturally identified as an effective tetrad field for the fermions. The correspondence between the tetrad field and an effective quasi-relativistic metric gμν governing the Weyl fermions allows for the possibility to simulate different classes of metric fields emerging in general relativity in interacting Weyl semimetals. According to this correspondence, there can be four types of Weyl fermions, depending on the signs of the components g 00 and g 00 of the effective metric. In addition to the conventional type-I fermions with a tilted Weyl cone and type-II fermions with an overtilted Weyl cone for g 00 > 0 and, respectively, g 00 > 0 or g 00 < 0, we find additional “type-III” and “type-IV” Weyl fermions with instabilities (complex frequencies) for g 00 < 0 and g 00 > 0 or g 00 < 0, respectively.

The characteristic features of this dependence are determined by the change in the number of transport channels with the growth of the applied voltage. For all junctions under study with zigzag edges oriented toward each other, it is found that the tunneling current exhibits characteristic peaks related to the existence of the localized edge states. The effects induced by the gate voltage are also studied. For the structures with zigzag edges, it is shown that the effect of switching off/on takes place for the junctions.

Velocity auto-correlation function Z is the established detector of evolution of fluid particles dynamics. Usually, complex singularities of correlation functions give more information. For this reason, we investigate Z in complex plane of frequencies using numerical analytic continuation. We have found that naive picture with few isolated poles fails describing Z(ω) of one-component Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid. Instead, we see the singularity manifold forming branch cuts extending approximately parallel to the real frequency axis. That suggests LJ velocity autocorrelation function is a multivalued function of complex frequency. The branch cuts are separated from the real axis by the well-defined “gap” whose width corresponds to an important time scale of a fluid characterizing crossover of system dynamics from kinetic to hydrodynamic regime. Our working hypothesis is that the branch cut origin is related to competition between one-particle dynamics and hydrodynamics.

The magnitude of the acoustic drag flux in the exciton gas at high temperatures has been calculated taking into account the exciton-exciton interaction. It has been shown that the drag flux at typical experimental parameters (at a given intensity of the surface acoustic wave (SAW)) is independent of the frequency of the acoustic wave, whereas the interaction between excitons leads to screening of the SAW-induced perturbation, which results in an exponentially fast decrease in the drag flux with an increase in the exciton density. At low temperatures, in the presence of a condensate, the drag flux of condensate particles exhibits a resonance character when the velocity of Bogoliubov excitations approaches the velocity of the acoustic wave and the magnitude of the flux is linear in the SAW frequency. The drag flux of the above-condensate particles has a threshold character: the above-condensate particles are dragged by the wave at a velocity of the acoustic wave higher than the bogolon velocity.

This effect is not observed in the case of the normal incidence of electrons on the surface of a thin crystal where the channeling of electrons, which occurs at certain orientation of the crystal, is absent.

The model is based on the calculation of the equilibrium potential of the film surface faced to the plasma for the region of the negative bias of the electrode with respect to the plasma potential. Balance involves currents of ions and electrons from the plasma, secondary emission currents, and field electron emission current from the electrode into the plasma through the insulator.

The main factor that determines the mechanism of the formation of this superconductivity is the “magic angle” of twist of two graphene layers, at which the electronic band structure becomes nearly flat. The specific role played by twist and by the band flattening has been earlier suggested for explanations of the signatures of room-temperature superconductivity observed in the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), when the quasi two-dimensional interfaces between the twisted domains are present. The interface contains the periodic array of misfit dislocations (analogs of the boundaries of the unit cell of the Moiré superlattice in bilayer graphene), which provide the possible source of the flat band. This demonstrates that it is high time for combination of the theoretical and experimental efforts in order to reach the reproducible room-temperature superconductivity in graphite or in similar real or artificial materials.

Consequently, heat transfer near the interface is less efficient. The effect is independent of the insulator adjacent to the metal. An exact solution has been obtained in a linear approximation. The results explain the qualitative difference of predictions of previously accepted models from experimental data in the case of large transmission coefficients of phonons through the interface.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23994949@JETP_LETTERS

The combination of high-resolution diffraction and the real-time detection of diffraction spectra makes it possible to establish that, in contrast to traditional notions, the structure of this compound at room temperature is a phase with only a partially ordered arrangement of Fe and Al in a unit cell. A completely ordered phase (such as Fe3Al) is present in the form of mesoscopic (~200Å) clusters coherently incorporated into the disordered matrix of the main phase. After the transition of the sample to a disordered state (T> 740°С) and slow cooling to room temperature, the size of structurally ordered clusters increases to ~900 Å.

The amplification mechanism in these lasers is based on population inversion between the ground Wannier–Stark level in the superlattice quantum wells and the weakly populated upper Wannier–Stark level in the wells two, three, or four periods down in the applied potential. Multiple regions of intense stimulated microwave emission near voltages of 8, 13, and 20 V (i.e., in the vicinity of resonances between these Wannier–Stark levels of the superlattice) have been discovered in the laser chips. The stimulated emission emerges in the circuit formed by the chip and its wiring. The emission from one of the chips at a temperature of up to 150 K (near 20 V applied to the chip) occurs at a frequency of about 7.3 GHz and has an estimated power of up to 1 W. It has been shown that the negative conductivity responsible for the emission still persists at 300 K but the emission is unseen owing to high losses in the circuit at this temperature. The superlattice wafer has been grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. It consists of 1000 periods and a stop layer, to produce a metal–superlattice–metal terahertz resonator.

The key parameter is the ratio L/λ, where λ = 895 nm is the wavelength of laser radiation resonant with the D 1 line. The comparison of the parameters for two selected thicknesses L = λ and λ/2 has revealed an unusual behavior of the Faraday rotation signal: the spectrum of the Faraday rotation signal at L = λ/2 = 448 nm is several times narrower than the spectrum of the signal at L = λ, whereas its amplitude is larger by a factor of about 3. These differences become more dramatic with an increase in the power of the laser: the amplitude of the Faraday rotation signal at L = λ/2 increases, whereas the amplitude of the signal at L = λ almost vanishes. Such dependences on L are absent in centimeter-length cells. They are inherent only in nanocells. In spite of a small thickness, L = 448 nm, the Faraday rotation signal is certainly detected at magnetic fields ≥0.4 G, which ensures its application. At thicknesses L < 150 nm, the Faraday rotation signal exhibits “redshift,” which is manifestation of the van der Waals effect.

The presence of background turbulence with large-scale helical perturbations and small-scale sources of the energy and helicity is a determining circumstance in this mechanism. The possibility of the inverse cascade in the case of incomplete degeneracy of one of the helicity components has been studied in the numerical experiments with the cascade model. It has been shown that the existence of the inverse (toward large scales) energy flux from small-scale perturbations requires a certain external-action-generated level of helical noise in large modes, which depends on the degree of “mixing” of different-sign helical components of the velocity field.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26798462@JETP_LETTERS

Recent comprehensive structural studies [V. Baledent et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 117601 (2015)] have shown that the actual symmetry of RMn2O5 at room temperature is a noncentrosymmetric monoclinic space group Pm, which allows room temperature ferroelectricity to exist. However, such a polarization has not yet been found. Our electric polarization loop studies of GdMn2O5 have revealed that a polarization does exist up to room temperature. This polarization occurs mainly in restricted polar domains that arise in the initial GdMn2O5 matrix due to phase separation and charge carrier self-organization. These domains are selfconsistent with the matrix, which leads to the noncentrosymmetricity of the entire crystal. The polarization is controlled by a magnetic field, thereby demonstrating the presence of magnetoelectric coupling. The lowtemperature ferroelectricity enhances the restricted polar domain polarization along the b axis.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27154509@JETP_LETTERS

The recurrence can be considered as a result of the nonlinear development of the modulation instability. All known exact localized solitary wave solutions describing propagation on the background of the modulationally unstable condensate show the recurrence to the condensate state after its interaction with solitons. The condensate state locally recovers its original form with the same amplitude but a different phase after soliton leave its initial region. Based on the integrability of the NLSE, we demonstrate that the FPU recurrence takes place not only for condensate, but also for a more general solution in the form of the cnoidal wave. This solution is periodic in space and can be represented as a solitonic lattice. That lattice reduces to isolated soliton solution in the limit of large distance between solitons. The lattice transforms into the condensate in the opposite limit of dense soliton packing. The cnoidal wave is also modulationally unstable due to soliton overlapping. The recurrence happens at the nonlinear stage of the modulation instability. Due to generic nature of the underlying mathematical model, the proposed concept can be applied across disciplines and nonlinear systems, ranging from optical communications to hydrodynamics.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29474362@JETP_LETTERS

The problem is considered in the oneloop approximation for the quark loops. We employ the minimal superposition linear in the fields, a μ ' = a μ − c∂μπ, and show that the covariant transformation properties of both the axial-vector and vector physical fields are affected by this substitution. Contrary to some claims found in the literature, we demonstrate that the discussed change in covariant transformation properties of these fields does not result in various violations of chiral symmetry, but rather reduces to a redefinition of the S-matrix elements beyond the mass shell. At the same time, the covariant and noncovariant approaches yield identical on-shell results.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29525108@JETP_LETTERS

It is shown that the establishment of the condensate coherence is accompanied by narrowing of the polariton momentum distribution. At the same time, at sufficiently high excitation densities, there is significant qualitative discrepancy between the dynamic behavior of the width of the polariton momentum distribution determined from direct measurements and that calculated from the spatial distribution of coherence. This discrepancy is observed at the fast initial stage of the polariton system kinetics and, apparently, results from the strong spatial nonuniformity of the phase of the condensate wavefunction, which equilibrates on a much longer time scale.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23991156@JETP_LETTERS

The conductivity at zero bias voltage increased with the field by 2–4 orders of magnitude. The effect is hysteretic.

The experiments were performed with a microtron with a particle energy of 7.4 MeV as the source of electrons and aluminum-lead and aluminum-copper foils. The thicknesses of aluminum, lead, and copper layers were 54 mg/cm2 (200 μm), 44 mg/cm2 (50 μm), and 79 mg/cm2 (70 μm), respectively. The particles were injected at the angles α = 5°−30° to the foil surface. The measurements were performed at various orientations of a bimetal with respect to the trajectory of the beam. In the first case, the particles moving through the foil first crossed the aluminum layer and then the layer of a higher density metal (copper or lead). In the opposite case, the particles were injected into the copper or lead layer and then crossed the aluminum layer. It has been found that changing the order of the metallic layers to the opposite one considerably affects the angles of reflection and refraction at some angles of incidence. Similar measurements have been carried out for electrons incident on scatterers made of homogeneous metals (aluminum, copper, and lead).

It does not coincide with the value Jpd = 43.31(5) Hz found theoretically by Helgaker et al. in the development of new methods of precise quantum-mechanical calculations at t ≈ 300 K. As was shown by Ledbetter et al., the difference between the experimental and theoretical data for the spinspin coupling constant Jpd in HD allows estimating the limits of existence of anomalous spin-dependent potentials between the nucleons on the atomic scale with orders-of-magnitude higher accuracy than other methods. From the earlier data on this difference (ΔJpd ≈ 0.24 Hz), Ledbetter et al. estimated the upper limit for the mass of pseudoscalar (axion-like) bosons as m  a  ≤ 1000 eV. By analogy with these estimates, the discrepancy ΔJpd ≈ (0.195 ± 0.051) Hz of the new results can be interpreted as the manifestation of the anomalous interaction.

Particularly, the spectra approach the asymptotic regime, namely, they weakly depend on the collision energy at momenta of projectile protons larger than 5–6 GeV/c; the spectra for various nuclei are similar, and can be approximately described by the function A n f(E). Experimental data on neutron spectra in the case of projectile π-mesons show analogous behavior, but the statistics of the data do not allow one to draw clear conclusions. In our analysis we used ITEP experimental data on inclusive cross sections of neutrons produced in interactions of π-mesons and protons with various nuclei in the energy range from 747 MeV up to 8.1 GeV. The observed properties allow one to predict neutron yields in the nucleus–nucleus interactions at high and super high energies. Predictions for the NICA/MPD experiment at JINR are presented. It is shown that the FTF (Fritiof)-model of the Geant4 toolkit qualitatively reproduces the observed regularities.

This classification is commonly accepted and involves the following statements [L. Fu and C. L. Kane, Phys. Rev. B 76, 045302 (2007)]: (i) nontrivial ℒ2 invariants imply the existence of gapless surface states, (ii) the ℒ2 invariants can be deduced from the topological structure of the Bloch wave functions of the bulk crystal in the Brillouin zone. In this work, a simple counterexample has been given for the ℒ2 classification. It has been shown that both topologically stable and topologically unstable surface states can exist on surfaces, at the same bulk, at the same space symmetry of a semi-infinite crystal, and, correspondingly, at a trivial value of the ℒ2 invariant (at the trivial class of equivalence of the bulk Hamiltonian) for the 3D → 2D system. Furthermore, topologically stable surface states can exist at both trivial (Bi(111) surface) and nontrivial (Sb(111) surface) values of the bulk ℒ2 invariant. In view of these facts, the statement that the ℒ2 classification based on the bulk–boundary correspondence is responsible for the appearance and topological stability of surface states is doubtful.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24963720@JETP_LETTERS

With an increase in the temperature, the contact angle θ between the (Cu)/(Cu) grain boundary in a Cu-based solid solution based and particles of the δ-phase (Cu70In30) decreases gradually. Above T W = 370°C, the first (Cu)/(Cu) grain boundaries completely “wetted” by the δ phase appear in Cu-In polycrystals. In other words, the δ phase forms continuous layers along grain boundaries and θ = 0. At 440°C, the fraction of completely wetted grain boundaries reaches a maximum (93%), whereas the average contact angle reaches a minimum (θ = 2°). With a further increase in the temperature, the fraction of completely wetted grain boundaries decreases and vanishes again at T DW = 520°C.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no theoretical models are available for that effect. Traditional Markov chain models do not provide a reasonable molecular mechanistic insight on the origin of the temperature effects. Here in the paper we address a simple physically clear electron-conformational model to describe the RyR gating and argue that a synergetic effect of external thermal fluctuation forces (Gaussian–Markovian noise) and internal friction via the temperature stimulation/suppression of the open–close RyR tunneling probability can be considered as a main contributor to temperature effects on the RyR gating.

It is shown that, in such systems, the pinning of domain walls by structural defects occurring when the evolution starts from the low-temperature state leads to significant changes in the nonequilibrium “aging” and “memory” effects in comparison to those characteristic of the “pure” system. As a result, in the long-term regime at times t–t w » t w » 1, an anomalously strong slowing down in the correlation effects is revealed. It is shown that a decrease in the autocorrelation function with time occurs according to a power law typical of the critical relaxation of the magnetization in contrast to a usual scaling dependence.

In particular, wrinkles can appear in graphene, which is the thinnest natural membrane, and affect its properties. A region where wrinkles with different wavelengths are linked is called wrinklon. Conditions of the fixing of an elastically deformed graphene sheet dictate a certain wavelength of wrinkles near the fixed edge. Wrinkles with a longer wavelength become more energetically favorable with an increase in the distance from the edge. As a result, wrinklons appear and reduce the potential energy of the system by uniting wrinkles into larger wrinkles with an increase in the distance from the edge. The possibility of implementing various equilibrium configurations of wrinklons at given plane strains in graphene has been demonstrated by the molecular quasistatic method. The distributions of the energy and elastic strain components in wrinklons with various configurations for nanoribbons with different widths have been calculated.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24029861@JETP_LETTERS

However, a big practical interest lies in the task of bending and extracting charged particles with energies below 1 GeV, for example, for the production of ultrastable beams of low emittance for medical and biological applications. That is why a novel crystal technique, namely thin straight crystal targets, is investigated in this article, using crystals as elements for extraction and collimation of the circulating beam in a ring accelerator. The advantages of reflection in straight crystals in comparison with bent crystal channeling consist in the small length of straight crystals along the beam that reduces the amount of nuclear interactions and improves the background.

Unlike other iron pnictide parent compounds where the typical oxidation state of iron is 2, the formal valence of Fe in KFe2As2 is 2.5, corresponding to an effective doping with 0.5 hole per iron atom compared to, for example, BaFe2As2. This shifts the chemical potential and thereby reduces the distance between the peaks in the spectral functions of KFe2As2 and the Fermi energy as compared to BaFe2As2. The shift, which is clearly seen on the level of DFT as well as in DMFT, is further enhanced by the strong electronic correlations in KFe2As2. In BaFe2As2 the presence of these peaks results (Phys. Rev. B 86, 125124 (2012)) in a temperature increase in the susceptibility up to a maximum at ∼1000 K. While the temperature increase was observed experimentally the decrease at even higher temperatures is outside the range of experimental observability. We show that in KFe2As2 the situation is different. Namely, the reduction of the distance between the peaks and the Fermi level due to doping shifts the maximum in the susceptibility to much lower temperatures, such that the decrease in the susceptibility becomes visible in experiment.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23994944@JETP_LETTERS

2017@Борич М А|Бунков Ю М|Куркин М И|Танкеев А П|@Nuclear magnetic relaxation induced relaxation electron spins@3@A physical mechanism responsible for the relaxation of nuclear spins coupled by the hyperfine interaction to relaxed electron spins in materials with spin ordering is proposed. The rate of such induced nuclear spin relaxation is proportional to the dynamic shift of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequency. Therefore, its maximum effect on the NMR signal should be expected in the case of nuclear spin waves existing in the system. Our estimates demonstrate that the induced relaxation can be much more efficient than that occurring due to the Bloch mechanism. Moreover, there is a qualitative difference between the induced and Bloch relaxations. The dynamics of nuclear spin sublattices under conditions of the induced relaxation is reduced to the rotation of m1 and m2 vectors without any changes in their lengths (m 1 2 (t) = m 2 2 (t) = m 0 2 (t)= const). This means that the excitation of NMR signals by the resonant magnetic field does not change the temperature T n of the nuclear spin system. This is a manifestation of the qualitative difference between the induced and Bloch relaxations. Indeed, for the latter, the increase in T n accompanying the saturation of NMR signals is the dominant effect.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29493556@JETP_LETTERS

The samples of the first type are fine-crystalline optimally doped ones with different degrees of nanoscale structural inhomogeneity. The second type includes coarse-crystalline equilibrium samples with different hole doping levels. A similarity in the behavior of different contributions to the specific heat for structurally inhomogeneous and underdoped samples is revealed. The samples of both types exhibit a metal-like contribution linear in temperature to the specific heat ~γT, which is not characteristic of the superconducting phase. It is found that this contribution moderately grows with the decrease in the oxygen content, whereas with the increase in the structural inhomogeneity, such growth of the linear contribution (γT) becomes anomalously large. This leads to the conclusion about the coexistence of metallic and superconducting states in the bulk of the samples under study. Such common feature of electron systems could be related to the formation of the pseudogap regime. It is demonstrated that this regime suppresses just the superconducting states, leaving intact the metallic ones.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29502498@JETP_LETTERS

Electron gas is assumed to be attracted to the helium surface due to the image attracting force and an external stationary electric field. The alternating electric field has both vertical and in-plane components. The photogalvanic effect originates from the periodic transitions of electrons between quantum subbands in the vertical direction caused by a normal component of the alternating electric field accompanied by synchronous in-plane acceleration/deceleration due to the electric field in-plane component. The effect needs vertical asymmetry of the system. The problem is considered taking into account a friction caused by the electron-ripplon interaction.

It is shown in this work that, under rather general assumptions, the boson peak emerges in a natural way in very dissimilar models of stable random dynamic matrices possessing translational symmetry. This peak can be shifted toward both higher and lower frequencies (down to zero frequency) by varying the parameters of the distribution and the degree of disorder in the system.

The equations of motion of the interface describing this regime can be reduced to an arbitrary number of ordinary differential equations describing the propagation and interaction of structurally stable solitary waves, viz. rational solitons.

The use of small angle neutron scattering data together with magnetic susceptibility measurements down to 0.4 K and precise magnetoresistance measurements in the temperature range 2–20 K in magnetic field up to 5 T allowed us to construct the magnetic phase diagram of this compound in which at low magnetic fields B < 0.15 T an intermediate phase with short-range magnetic order exists in a wide temperature range 0.62 K < T < 9.1 K. It was found that the increase in magnetic field first results in the suppression of a transition to the spiral phase with long-range magnetic order at very low temperatures, and then induces a transition of the intermediate phase to a spin-polarized (ferromagnetic) phase with lowering temperature. The temperature of this transition T SP increases with magnetic field logarithmically, T SP ~ log(B), and results in formation of a singular point on the magnetic phase diagram located at T ~ 8.5 K and B ~ 3.5 T, which may be either a triple or a critical point.

This phenomenon is new for cobalt and manganese oxides. The symmetric or shifted hysteresis loops (depending on the cooling method) for the resistivity correspond to similar loops for the magnetization. The angular dependence of the resistivity is described by the relation Δρ ~ sinθ, where the angle θ = 0 corresponds to the direction of magnetization, at which the sample has been cooled. The results are interpreted in terms of the exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases.

The experimental dependence differs qualitatively from those obtained earlier for the inelastic signals, as well as from the field-induced magnetic form factor of SmB6 obtained by polarized neutron diffraction. This observation is interpreted by specifically considering the Curie-type contributions to the dynamic susceptibility, which arise from the mixing of 4 f 5 and 4 f 6 J-multiplets into the intermediate valence state wavefunction.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27125902@JETP_LETTERS

It has been shown that δF thr increases with a decrease in the length of a bridge for short bridges with lengths L < ξ (where ξ is the coherence length) and is saturated for long bridges with L ≫ ξ. At certain geometrical parameters of banks and bridge, the function δF thr(L) at the current I → 0 has a minimum at L ~ (2–3)ξ. These results indicate that the effect of fluctuations on Josephson junctions made in the form of short superconducting bridges is reduced and that the effect of fluctuations on bridges with lengths ~(2–3)ξ is enhanced.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27138611@JETP_LETTERS

The dielectric resonators are fabricated on Si/SiO2 substrates where periodic arrays of square 10- to 200-nm-high dielectric pillars are produced via electron-beam lithography and plasma etching. The lateral size a of the pillars varies between 50 and 1500 nm, and their period in the array is 2a. To make a combined dielectric/metal resonator, a nanostructured layer of silver is deposited onto the fabricated periodic dielectric structure by thermal evaporation. It is established that, for a fixed height of the dielectric pillars, the Raman scattering enhancement factor experiences pronounced oscillations as a function of the period (and size) of the pillars.

Dynamical networks are networks where the structure of links varies in time owing to the presence of the individual “activity” of each site, which determines the probability of establishing links with other sites per unit time. An interesting case where the times of existence of links in a network are equal to the avalanche development times has been examined. A new mathematical model of a system with the avalanche dynamics has been constructed including changes in the network on which avalanches are developed. A square lattice with a variable structure of links has been considered as a dynamical network within this model. Avalanche processes on it have been simulated using the modified Abelian sandpile model and fixed-energy sandpile model. It has been shown that avalanche processes on the dynamical lattice under study are more stable than a static lattice with respect to the appearance of catastrophic events. In particular, this is manifested in a decrease in the maximum size of an avalanche in the Abelian sandpile model on the dynamical lattice as compared to that on the static lattice. For the fixed-energy sandpile model, it has been shown that, in contrast to the static lattice, where an avalanche process becomes infinite in time, the existence of avalanches finite in time is always possible.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27100217@JETP_LETTERS

The crystal structure of FeSi, MnSi, and CoSi silicides is P213(B20), whereas FeS2, CoS2, and MnS2 sulfides have a structure of pyrite Pa3. Despite the great interest in these systems and the cubic symmetry of crystals, the structure and compressibility of these compounds at high pressures are still insufficiently studied. There is a significant spread (more than a factor of two!) in the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative for a single compound. Most studies were performed under nonhydrostatic conditions. In this work, the compressibility of FeSi and MnSi silicides (at pressures up to 35 GPa) and CoS2 sulfide (up to 22 GPa) has been studied by the X-ray diffraction method in a diamond anvil cell with the use of helium as the softest pressure-transmitting medium.

In particular, the type-II Weyl fermions may emerge behind the event horizon of black holes. The type-II Weyl and Dirac points also emerge as the intermediate states of the topological Lifshitz transitions. In one case, the type-II Weyl point connects the Fermi pockets, and the Lifshitz transition corresponds to the transfer of the Berry flux between the Fermi pockets. In the other case, the type-II Weyl point connects the outer and inner Fermi surfaces. At the Lifshitz transition, the Weyl point is released from both Fermi surfaces. They loose their Berry flux, which guarantees the global stability, and without the topological support, the inner surface disappears after shrinking to a point at the second Lifshitz transition. These examples reveal the complexity and universality of topological Lifshitz transitions, which originate from the ubiquitous interplay of a variety of topological characters of the momentum-space manifolds.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31033595@JETP_LETTERS

The calculated two-time autocorrelation function and the staggered magnetization of the structure at its evolution starting from various initial states are analyzed. The analysis reveals aging effects characterized by a slowing down of the relaxation and correlation characteristics in the system with the waiting time. It is shown that, in contrast to bulk magnetic systems, the aging effects in magnetic superstructures arise not only near the ferromagnetic ordering temperature T c in the films but also within a wide temperature range at T ≤ T c.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29492741@JETP_LETTERS

Change in the density of molecular gases has been measured as a function of the illumination duration, intensity and wavelength of light, and temperature of the coating. A linear dependence of the rate of photoextraction on the intensity of the incident light has been established. Similar to the photoelectric effect, photoextraction is absent in the long-wavelength spectral range down to 550 nm. The effect increases sharply in the short-wavelength spectral range below a threshold of about 550 nm. Photoextraction is absent at temperatures below the glass-transition temperature of PDMS (−125°C), at which, as is known, the bulk diffusion of molecular gases in the film is strongly suppressed. At long-term irradiation of the film, the number of photoextracted molecules decreases exponentially with time. This increase is accompanied by a long tail of a diffusion form. The results indicate that photoextraction has a nonthermal nature and demonstrate the important role of bulk diffusion in the process of light-induced extraction of molecules from the surface.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23981748@JETP_LETTERS

It is found that the density of states of Dirac electrons is a linear function of the Fermi energy at E F > 30 meV with the corresponding velocity vDF = 8.2 × 105 m/s. At lower energies, this dependence deviates from the linear law, indicating a strong effect of disorder, which is associated with fluctuations of a built-in charge, on the density of states of the studied system near the Dirac point. At negative energies, a sharp increase in the density of states is observed, which is associated with the tail of the density of states of valleys of heavy holes.

For modern organic photosensitive materials with p-n junction size on the order of 10–20 nm, Y  b  could be close to 1.

They involve two coupled order parameters characterizing this transition: (i) a scalar order parameter describing the density change accompanying the transition from the insulating state to the metallic one and (ii) an order parameter (a two-component vector) describing the electron density in the metallic or semimetallic phase affected by the applied magnetic field. Two components of this vector correspond to different possible spin states of electrons in the applied magnetic field. The transition in the density of metallic and insulating phases being a first order phase transition is treated in terms of the Cahn-Hilliard-type gradient expansion. The transition in the electron density is a second order phase described by the Ginzburg-Landau-type functional. The coupling of these two parameters is described by the term linearly dependent on the electron density n in the metal with the proportionality factor being a function of the density of the metallic phase. The derived equations are solved in the case of the MI interface in the presence of both parallel and perpendicular uniform magnetic fields. The calculated surface tension Σmi between the metallic and insulating phases has a singular behavior. In the limit of zero electron density n ⟹ 0, Σmi ∼ n 3/2. Near the MI transition point T c(h) in the applied magnetic field, Σmi ∼ [T - T c(h)]3/2. The singular behavior of the surface tension at the MI interface results in the clearly pronounced hysteresis accompanying the transition from the insulating to metallic state and vice versa.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=21869567@JETP_LETTERS

An experiment on the deflection of a 400 GeV/c proton beam and a 150 GeV/c π− beam at CERN using a multi-strip silicon deflector in reflection mode is described. The mean deflection angle of beam particles has been considerably increased due to sequential volume reflections realized in the deflector.

The most of radio-loud pulsars are detected by Fermi LAT by using the radio timing models, while the radio-quiet ones are discovered in a blind search. The difference in the techniques introduces an observational selection bias and, consequently, the direct comparison of populations is complicated. In order to produce an unbiased sample, we perform a blind search of gamma-ray pulsations using Fermi-LAT data alone. No radio data or observations at optical or X-ray frequencies are involved in the search process. We produce a gamma-ray selected catalog of 25 non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars found in a blind search, including 16 radio-quiet and 9 radio-loud pulsars. This results in the direct measurement of the fraction of radio-quiet pulsars ɛRQ = 64 ± 10%, which is in agreement with the existing estimates from the population modeling in the outer magnetosphere model. The Polar cap models are disfavored due to a lower expected fraction and the prediction of age dependence. The age, gamma-ray energy flux, spin-down luminosity and sky location distributions of the radio-loud and radio-quiet pulsars from the catalog do not demonstrate any statistically significant difference. The results indicate that the radio-quiet and radio-loud pulsars belong to one and the same population.

The spectrum in the relativistic energy range has been estimated within the previously proposed “effective-energy method.” In this method, each ground-based instrument is assigned the corresponding effective momentum (or energy) of primary particles at which the flux of solar cosmic rays is determined. The effective momentum is chosen such that errors in the determination of the solar-particle spectrum are minimized. It has been shown that the error of the estimate of the effective momentum within the proposed method for the determination of solar-particle fluxes is no more than 20 MeV/c. It has been found that the spectrum of solar cosmic rays from the event under study measured in the orbit of the Earth extends from ≈40 keV to ≈5 GeV and is described by a power law with an exponential cutoff at relativistic energies. A quasilinear theory of the regular acceleration of charged particles by shock waves in the lower corona of the Sun, which was developed at the Shafer Institute of Cosmophysical Research and Aeronomy, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, has been used to reveal the nature of solar cosmic rays.

It has been shown that the saturation of optical absorption can result in a significant rearrangement of the electronic structure and properties in the near infrared spectral range in the considered film. In particular, the semiconductor (in the absence of interaction with light) type of conductivity of the film can be changed to the metallic type of conductivity strongly nonlinear in the intensity of light.

As the increasing C−C distance, the magnetic coupling between the moments induced by two C is found to be AFM and the origin of the coupling can be attributed to the p−p hybridization interaction involving polarized electrons.

In the steady-state regime, it is shown that by increasing the strength of Fano-interference as well as enhancement of energy splitting of two excited states the slope of dispersion changes from negative to positive which is corresponding to a switch between superluminal to subluminal light propagation. At the same time, the probe absorption reduces at telecommunication wavelength λ = 1550 nm. The influence of incoherent pumping fields on time-dependent susceptibility is then discussed. It is found that due to more transfer of population to the upper levels, increasing the rate of incoherent pump field leads to the reduction of probe absorption. In addition, it is realized that incoherent pumping has a major role in converting fast to slow propagation of light at long wavelength. We also introduce an extra controllability for the light pulse to be slow downed at Telecom wavelength just through the quantum interference arising from incoherent pumping fields.

The study deals with a two-dimensional sample irradiated by two electromagnetic waves, at the fundamental and doubled frequencies. Both frequencies exceed the band gap of the material, whereas the wave with the fundamental frequency having circular polarization and a high intensity is taken into account in a nonperturbative manner. The wave at the doubled frequency is linearly polarized and the electrical conductivity of the two-dimensional system is calculated with respect to it. The effect under study manifests itself as the dc Hall current in the direction orthogonal to the electric field of the weak electromagnetic wave. It is assumed that, in equilibrium, the sample is in the insulating state with the completely occupied valence band and empty conduction band. The strong electromagnetic wave induces a nonequilibrium filling of the bands and the system passes to a strongly nonequilibrium steady state. The behavior of the Hall current in the case of nonequilibrium distribution functions is analyzed both including and disregarding the intraband relaxation and interband recombination.

The analysis of these results has shown that an increase in the initial period of the lattice from 417.6 to 418.0 pm after processing at a pressure of 3 GPa and to 418.5 pm at a pressure of 6 GPa is due to the filling of vacant sites of the crystal structure with atoms. The ab initio quantum calculations indicate that the equilibrium period of the lattice should increase monotonically by 2% at a decrease in the concentration of vacancies from 16.7 to 0%. After aging the samples under normal conditions, the period of the lattice is no more than 421.0 pm and the concentration of vacancies is no lower than 11% because of the instability of the structure at lower concentrations of vacancies.

Nonequilibrium charge carriers are excited by laser pulses at a wavelength of 222 nm with FWHM pulse duration of 18 ns and peak intensity above 2.5 MW/cm2 upon cooling the sample to 90 K. For peak intensities of laser excitation lower than 1 MW/cm2, sample cooling from 300 to 90 K leads to a decrease in pulsed photocurrent by about a factor of 5. The observed increase in pulsed photocurrent is attributed to the formation of the electron–hole liquid.

Significant luminescence output increments—1.7-fold for radial polarization compared to the azimuthal one, and almost 3-fold—compared to the linear one, have been observed. This effect is related to significant transformation of the transverse electrical field component into longitudinal one for radial polarization (up to 33% in intensity, according to our calculations), and corresponding increase in excitation efficiency of plasmons in the smaller nanocrystallites throughout the film.

Islands thicker than a nanofilm are prepared and studied, which are unstable inside the dislocation loops, since they increase the energy of the film. Such instability leads to the decrease in the size of islands and is terminated by their collapse. The time dependence of the size of islands is measured experimentally. It is shown that the found dependence is in agreement with the theory of the dynamics of dislocation loops in smectic films developed earlier with allowance for the dissipation of energy in the film and in the meniscus. A nontrivial dynamic coupling between islands in a film resembling Ostwald ripening is also found, though the nonequilibrium kinetics of unstable islands, at which the hydrodynamic flow through a film leads to the decrease in sizes of one island and the increase in those of the other, rather than of the growth of the nucleation centers in the thermodynamically stable phase from the metastable state of the system (described by the Lifshitz–Slezov theory in films), is studied in our experiments.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31153113@JETP_LETTERS

The magnitude and sign of the induced trapped moment remain unchanged when the applied magnetic field is varied within ±1 T at T K. The trapped magnetic flux is manifested in the displacement of the magnetization curve relative to that of the sample cooled in zero field. Displacement magnitude gradually decreases with the temperature increase up to 350 K, not reaching zero.

In the context of repulsive-U Hubbard model and Shubin–Vonsovsky model we consider briefly the superconducting phase diagrams and the symmetries of the order parameter in novel strongly correlated electron systems including idealized monolayer and bilayer graphene. We stress that purely repulsive fermion systems are mainly the subject of unconventional low-temperature superconductivity. To get the high temperature superconductivity in cuprates (with TC of the order of 100 K) we should proceed to the t–J model with the van der Waals interaction potential and the competition between short-range repulsion and long-range attraction. Finally we note that to describe superconductivity in metallic hydrogen alloys under pressure (with TC of the order of 200 K) it is reasonable to reexamine more conventional mechanisms connected with elec-tron–phonon interaction. These mechanisms arise in the attractive-U Hubbard model with static onsite or intersite attractive potential or in more realistic theories (which include retardation effects) such as Migdal– Eliashberg strong coupling theory or even Fermi–Bose mixture theory of Ranninger et al. and its generalizations.

It has been established that this transfer, which appears at a positive potential of the probe, is due primarily to the effect of electron drag of the metal (Au). Estimates have been obtained for the effective radius of Au islands (2 nm), the width of a gap between islands (0.5 nm), the height of potential barriers (100 meV), and the characteristic resistance of tunnel junctions (30 kΩ ~ h/e2), which is typical of point quantum contacts.

Without an electric field, the system shows a small band gap of 126 meV at the equilibrium state. Interestingly, by applying a vertical external electric field, the results present a parabola-like relationship between the band gap and the strength. As the negative E-field changes from 0.0 to −0.40 V/Å, the band gap first increases to a maximum of about 378 meV and then decreases to zero. A similar trend is exhibited for the positive E-field, ranging from 0.0 to +0.40 V/Å. The band gap reaches a maximum of about 315 meV at +0.10 V/Å. The significant variations of band gap are owing to different states of Ge, Si, and C atoms in conduction band and valence band.

This result is new and quite surprising because previously it was believed that the maximum lifetime of torus knots until reconnection does not exceed several typical periods.

This process is reversible and its dynamics (duration of tens of minutes) corresponds to the formation of a screening layer near the insulator–metal interface owing to the counter migration of oxygen ions and vacancies in the external electric field. The formation of domains has been observed in the experiment as the broadening and splitting of the XRD curve and is explained by mechanical stresses that appear in the high electric field near the surface in view of the piezoelectric effect and are responsible for a ferroelectric α–β phase transition. A change in the lattice parameter near the anode (surface of the crystal with a positive external charge) has been detected simultaneously. This change is due to the local rearrangement of the crystal structure because of the inflow of oxygen ions in this region and outflow of oxygen vacancies.

Selection rules forbid these transitions in zero magnetic field. At the same time, the probabilities of these transitions in a magnetic field increase significantly; for this reason, we refer to these transitions as magnetically induced transitions. The following rule has been found for the intensities of 24 magnetically induced Fg = 3 → Fe = 5 and Fg = 4 → Fe = 2 transitions: the intensities of magnetically induced transitions with ΔF = +2 are maximal (the number of such magnetically induced transitions is also maximal) in the case of σ+ polarized radiation, whereas the intensities of magnetically induced transitions with ΔF = −2 are maximal (the number of such transitions is also maximal) in the case of σ− σ+ and σ− polarized radiation can reach several orders of magnitude; i.e., anomalous circular dichroism is observed. For an experimental test, absorption spectra of a Cs-filled nanocell with the thickness equal to half the wavelength of resonant laser radiation = 852 nm have been analyzed in order to separately detect magnetically induced transitions. The experiment is in good agreement with the theory. Possible applications have been discussed.

Unlike disordered QD structures, where ESR line broadening is usually observed (evidence of Dyakonov–Perel mechanism efficiency), the structures under study demonstrate the narrowing of ESR line when the external magnetic field deviates from the growth direction. The ESR line width is ΔH = 1.2 Oe for perpendicular magnetic field (along the growth direction) and ΔH = 0.8 Oe for in-plane magnetic field. The narrowing of ESR line can be explained by combination of two mechanisms. The first one is suppression of Dyakonov–Perel spin relaxation due to a settled direction of electron motion and finiteness of QD chains.

It has been demonstrated that the space-time anisotropy of the character of motion of the dislocations in opposite directions orthogonal to the roll structure takes place in such a nonstationary system.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24029847@JETP_LETTERS

In order to test the technique, we have chosen Schottky gated GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunctions and detected experimentally in this 2D system quantum magneto-oscillations of ∂μ/∂T. We also present a Lifshits-Kosevitch type theory for the ∂μ/∂T magneto-oscillations in 2D systems and compare the theory with experimental data. The magnetic field dependence of the ∂μ/∂T value appears to be sensitive to the density of states shape of Landau levels.

Remarkably, in this setup, essentially quantum effects survive thermal averaging: the high-temperature tunneling conductance G of a ring shows sharp dips (antiresonances) as a function of magnetic flux. We discuss effects of the electron-electron interaction, disorder, and spin-orbit coupling on the Aharonov-Bohm transport through the ring. The interaction splits the dip into series of dips broadened by dephasing. The physics behind this behavior is the persistent-current-blockade: the current through the ring is blocked by the circular current inside the ring. Dephasing is then dominated by tunneling-induced fluctuations of the circular current. The short-range disorder broadens antiresonances, while the long-range one induces additional dips. In the presence of a spin-orbit coupling, G exhibits two types of sharp antiresonances: Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher ones. In the vicinity of the antiresonances, the tunneling electrons acquire spin polarization, so that the ring serves as a spin polarizer.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=24010782@JETP_LETTERS

As a result, any contribution to resistance dependent on the Zeeman splitting of the spin subbands is amplified with respect to the direct effect of the external field.

Two peaks with centers at 1.7 and 0 nm−1 have been observed in the dependences of the intensity of neutron scattering on the momentum transfer. An increase in the temperature is accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of the first peak and an increase in the intensity of the second peak. In addition, the shape of the peak with the center at 1.7 nm−1 changes from Gaussian to Lorentzian. This change can be explained by the fact of the magnetic order-disorder transition from the helimagnet to the state with spatial ferromagnetic fluctuations occurs in YMn6Sn6 in the interval of 250–360 K. The anisotropy of the shape along the momentum transfer is observed for the peak with the center at 1.7 nm−1.

The exit momenta of ultrarelativistic electrons scattered are found using the exact solutions to the equations of motion with radiation reaction included (the Landau-Lifshitz equation). It is found that the momentum components of electrons traversed the electromagnetic wave depend weakly on the initial values of momenta. These electrons are mostly scattered at small angles to the propagation direction of the electromagnetic wave. The maximum Lorentz factor of electrons crossed the electromagnetic wave is proportional to the work done by the electromagnetic field and is independent of the initial momentum. The momentum component parallel to the electric field vector of the electromagnetic wave is determined solely by the laser beam diameter measured in the units of the classical electron radius.

It has been shown that the acceleration of the particle is determined by the friction force in the rest reference frame of the particle (K’ reference frame), which is not generally equal to the friction force in the reference frame specified by blackbody radiation (K reference frame). The difference between friction forces in different reference frames is due to a change in the rest mass of the particle owing to the absorption and emission of radiation by the particle. The friction force in the K’ reference frame is determined only by the interaction of the particle with blackbody radiation. Consequently, it depends only on the temperature of this radiation and is independent of the temperature of the particle. The interaction of the particle with its own thermal radiation in the K reference frame also contributes to the friction force. At a constant temperature of the particle, the friction forces in the K’ and K reference frames are equal to each other. The friction force of blackbody radiation for an atom is determined by the radiative broadening of an electron line of the atom, which is calculated by taking into account the interaction of the atom with its radiation. In the ultrarelativistic case (1 − β → 0), the friction force for the atom diverges as (1 − β)−3 and the (average) temperature of the atom is T 2 ≈ (1− β)−3/8 T 1, where T 1 is the temperature of blackbody radiation and β = V/c.

An experimental manifestation of a tunnel gap between the states of light carriers seen as a magnetoresistance (MR) peak in the in-plane magnetic field has been discovered. An unusual structure of the QHE has been observed in a sample with hole conductivity: there is a pronounced peak on a plateau with the number i = 2 and the slopes of this anomalous peak correspond to two peaks of the longitudinal MR. On the other hand, a stable 2–1 plateau–plateau transition has been observed in much higher fields with the position of this transition corresponding to a considerably higher hole density than follows from the pattern of the QHE in weak fields. The anomalous peak is interpreted as a reentrant QHE between the 2–1–2 states. The position of the anomalous peak is immune to IR illumination and the tilting angle of the magnetic field, although these factors strongly affect its amplitude. According to comparison with the calculated structure of magnetic levels, the anomalous peak is attributed to crossing of electron-like and hole-like levels in the valence band. The difference between the hole densities found in weak field and from the 2–1 transition in strong fields is attributed to the effects of redistribution of holes between the localized states in sideband maxima of the valence subband and the ones delocalized in the overlapping levels of light holes.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29474430@JETP_LETTERS

In the systems with gapped energy spectra, significant chemical-potential dependent distortions of the differential tunneling conductance curves, dI/dV, arise in the gap region. An expression is derived for the correction of dI/dV, which in a number of cases is found to be large. The sign of the correction depends on the chemical potential level position with respect to the gap.

A seven-fold increase in the integrated photoluminescence intensity is obtained for the structures with optimal thickness d = 2 nm. This enhancement is explained by increasing the overlap integral of electron and hole wavefunctions. Two main factors promote this increasing. The first one is that the electrons are localized at the QD base edges and their wavefunctions are the linear combinations of the states of in-plane Δ valleys, which are perpendicular in k-space to the growth direction [001]. This results in the increasing probability of electron penetration into Ge barriers. The second factor is the arrangement of Ge nanoclusters in closely spaced QD groups. The strong tunnel coupling of QDs within these groups increases the probability of hole finding at the QD base edge, that also promotes the increase in the radiative recombination probability.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29471047@JETP_LETTERS

We consider a simple model of a cylindrical nanowire, which is described by the 3D Dirac equation with a general T-invariant boundary condition. The boundary condition is determined by a single phenomenological parameter whose sign defines topological-like and non-topological surface states. The non-topological surface states emerge outside the gap. In a longitudinal magnetic field B, they lead to Aharonov–Bohm amendment for the density of states and correspondingly for the conductivity of the nanowire.

This statement is valid not only for targets specially designed for fast ignition. Fast heating by an external energy source can ensure the ignition of a target designed for spark ignition, but where this ignition does not occur because inhomogeneities are formed in the temperature and density distributions owing to the development of hydrodynamic instabilities. The condition for ignition is the fast heating of the plasma in the combustion initiation region whose size is comparable with the sizes of compression inhomogeneities. Thus, fast ignition not only significantly reduces the ignition energy, but also is possibly a necessary stage in the inertial confinement fusion scheme when the spherically symmetric compression of a target requires very high engineering and financial expenses.

It has also been found that the contribution from color-octet states should be taken into account to describe the ratio of the cross sections for the production of tensor and axial charmonia. These results have been used to analyze the single production of bottomonia, the pair production of heavy quarkonia, and the production of vector charmonium in jets. The resulting theoretical predictions are in good agreement with experimental data.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31044942@JETP_LETTERS

It is established that local surface oxide is formed at the first stage of adsorption. The subsequent adsorption of O results in the appearance of new objects with a size of 3–8 Å and a height of 1.0–1.5 Å on the Ag(111) surface, which form quasi-ordered structures with increasing degree of coating. The heating of the system obtained up to 500 K leads to a structural transition resulting in the formation of single islands of the p (4×4) phase on the surface.

In contrast to a static case where an upper bound in the radiative heat transfer between two particles exists, the quantum heat generation for two rotating particles diverges at distances between particles d < d0 = R(3/ε″(ω0))1/3 (where ε″(ω0) is the imaginary part of the dielectric function for the material of a particle at the resonance frequency ω0), when the rotation frequency coincides with poles in the excitation generation rate at Ω = 2ω0. These poles are due to the anomalous Doppler effect and the mutual polarization of particles and exist even in the presence of dissipation in particles. The anomalous heat generation is associated with the conversion of mechanical rotation energy into heat mediated by quantum friction. Similar singularities also exist for the interaction force and friction torque. The results can be of significant importance for biomedical applications.

The characteristics of the growth process that allow controlling the length and aspect ratio of the nanowires are established. The elemental composition and magnetic properties of the nanowires depend on the diameter of the track-etched pores, which varies from 30 to 200 nm, and the electrochemical potential U (650–850 mV), which determines the nanowire growth rate. According to the results of elemental analysis and the Mössbauer spectroscopy data, the Co content in Fe1-x Co x  lies in the range of x=0.20−0.25. It is found that the orientation of the magnetic moment of Fe–Co nanoparticles in the wires depends both on the track pore size d and on the nanowire growth rate. Thus, the magnetic moments in nanowires grown in 50-nm-diameter pores are oriented within 0°–40° with respect to the nanowire axis. The magnetic properties of the nanowires are explained in the framework of a theoretical model describing the magnetic dynamics of nanocomposites, which was extended to include the relaxation of the magnetization vector and to take into account interaction between the particles.

In addition to single-particle excitations associated with transitions between empty Landau levels of electrons and holes, collective plasma and magnetoplasma excitations in the system of electrons (and holes) of various densities have been discovered for the first time. Hybridization of plasma and cyclotron modes corresponding to the Kohn law has been shown to occur in the limit of high filling factors, which allows measuring directly the plasma and cyclotron energies. The dependence of the electron and hole velocities on their density has been investigated via the magnetic-field dependence of the cyclotron energy in free-hanging graphene. The effect of strong renormalization of the electron and hole dispersion relations seen as an increase in the velocity (by 40–50%) with a decrease in the charge-carrier density to 1011 cm–2 has been discovered. The charge-carrier density dependences of the widths of magnetoplasma resonances in free-hanging graphene and graphene lying on a silicon dioxide surface have been measured and shown to be at least 3.5 and 14.8 meV, respectively.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27576837@JETP_LETTERS

The results involving the comparison with the magnetic and transport characteristics are analyzed. In the reflection spectra from the (001) and (120) planes measured at T = 295 K (below the temperature corresponding to the transition to the semiconducting state, T MI = 345 K), a contribution from itinerant charge carriers has been revealed. This contribution is associated with the existence of an inhomogeneous charge state. In the reflection spectrum from the (120) plane, the contribution from itinerant charge carriers holds down to T = 80 K. The difference between the reflection spectra from different planes and different characters of their changes with the temperature are attributed to the anisotropy of the clusters with itinerant charge carriers.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27581828@JETP_LETTERS

The effect of different system parameters on OB and OM is explored. It is found that the threshold of onset of the OB can be controlled by manipulating the Rabi frequency of control fields. In this case, OB can be converted to OM. Then we investigate the effect of probe and control field detunings on OB behaviors. We found that the frequency detuning of probe field affects only the upper–lower branches of the OB curves but has no specific impact on OB threshold. By manipulating the first control field detuning, neither the OB threshold intensity nor upper–lower branches change. Finally, it is found that increasing the second control field detuning can reduce merely the OB threshold intensity, while no change happens in upper–lower OB branches.

We analyze scenarios when Bloch oscillations can be accompanied by the emission of radiation not only at the Bloch frequency but also with double and triple Bloch frequencies.

It is shown that the light scattering spectra contain a multicomponent quasi-elastic scattering (QELS) component observed in a broad frequency range, from 800 to 0.7 GHz. Reconstruction of the inelastic light scattering spectra in NBT in the frequency region from 0.7 to 800 GHz did not reveal relaxation processes (α and β relaxations) typical of disordered compounds (glasses, supercooled liquids, etc.). The fractal approach also proved to be inapplicable to the description of QELS in NBT. Detailed analysis of the Brillouin spectra with different free spectral ranges (“frequency windows”) showed that different contributions to the quasi-elastic light scattering manifest themselves in different frequency windows. These contributions are associated with the structural phase transitions and other processes responsible for the emergence of QELS (domain structure evolution, heterophase fluctuations, etc.). Thus, we suggest a new approach to the analysis of the temperature behavior of quasi-elastic scattering.

A combined approach to the analysis of multiple small-angle neutron scattering has been proposed on the basis of the synthesis of the Zernike–Prince and Moliére formulas. This approach has been compared to the existing multiple small-angle neutron scattering theory based on the eikonal approximation. This comparison has shown that the results in the diffraction limit coincide, whereas differences exist in the refraction limit because the latter theory includes correlations between successive scattering events. It has been shown analytically that the existence of correlations in the spatial position of scatterers results in an increase in the number of unscattered neutrons. Thus, the narrowing of spectra of multiple small-angle neutron scattering observed experimentally and in numerical simulation has been explained.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27100468@JETP_LETTERS

2015@Агладзе К И|Ерофеев И С|@Formation virtual isthmus new scenario spiral wave death decrease excitability@0@Termination of rotating (spiral) waves or reentry is crucial when fighting with the most dangerous cardiac tachyarrhythmia. To increase the efficiency of the antiarrhythmic drugs as well as finding new prospective ones it is decisive to know the mechanisms how they act and influence the reentry dynamics. The most popular view on the mode of action of the contemporary antiarrhythmic drugs is that they increase the core of the rotating wave (reentry) to that extent that it is not enough space in the real heart for the reentry to exist. Since the excitation in cardiac cells is essentially change of the membrane potential, it relies on the functioning of the membrane ion channels. Thus, membrane ion channels serve as primary targets for the substances, which may serve as antiarrhythmics. At least, the entire group of antiarrhythmics class I (modulating activity of sodium channels) and partially class IV (modulating activity of calcium channels) are believed to destabilize and terminate reentry by decreasing the excitability of cardiac tissue. We developed an experimental model employing cardiac tissue culture and photosensitizer (AzoTAB) to study the process of the rotating wave termination while decreasing the excitability of the tissue. A new scenario of spiral wave cessation was observed: an asymmetric growth of the rotating wave core and subsequent formation of a virtual isthmus, which eventually caused a conduction block and the termination of the reentry.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=26860305@JETP_LETTERS

The behavior of the volume thermal expansion coefficient in cobaltites with isovalent doping in the temperature range of 100–1000 K is studied. It is found that the β(T) curve exhibits two peaks at some doping levels. The rate of the change in the occupation number for the high-spin state of cobalt ions is calculated for the compounds under study taking into account the spin–orbit interaction. With the Birch–Murnaghan equation of state, it is demonstrated that the low-temperature peak in the thermal expansion shifts with the growth of the pressure toward higher temperatures and at pressure P ∼ 7 GPa coincides with the second peak. The similarity in the behavior of the thermal expansion coefficient in the La1–x Gd x CoO3 compounds with the isovalent substitution and the undoped LnCoO3 compound (Ln is a lanthanide) is considered.

Because of such tunneling the current–voltage characteristics of tunnel contact created between atomic force microscope tip and a surface of InAs/GaAs quantum dots display many interesting peaks. We found that the number, position, and heights of these peaks are associated with the phonon modes involved. To describe the found effect we use a quasi-classical approximation. There the tunneling current is related to a creation of a dilute instanton–anti-instanton gas. Our experimental data are well described with exactly solvable model where one charged particle is weakly interacting with two promoting phonon modes associated with external medium.

The magnetization of these films is determined by two ferromagnetic phases—the high-temperature phase with the Curie temperature T C ≈ 370 K and the low-temperature one with T C ≈ 46 K. The anomalous Hall effect changes sign from positive to negative with a decrease in temperature. The sign change occurs in the temperature range of 30–50 K; the specific value of this temperature depends on the thickness of the Mn x Si1–x  film. The results can be interpreted in terms of the structural self-organization related to the formation of two layers in the course of film growth. These layers have nearly the same chemical composition but significantly differ in the shapes and sizes of crystallites. This leads to a drastic difference in the values of T C and in the value and the sign of the anomalous Hall effect for such layers.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=27139469@JETP_LETTERS

The conventional scaling fails in application to the manganites with a hysteresis and the strong sensitivity of T C to a magnetic field. However, the application of the improved scaling procedure designed by us allows yielding the good scaling the magnetic heat =0.23 capacity in La0.85Ag0.15MnO3, which may belong to a new universality class for systems with the strong spin-orbital coupling of t 2g -electrons, namely, double -Heisenberg with the critical exponent of the heat capacity α = −0.23 and the critical exponent of the correlation radius v=0.7433.

It is based on the analysis of the 4-vector equation of motion of the charged particle together with the 4-vector and tensor equations for the components of the electromagnetic field tensor of a monochromatic plane wave. This approach provides analytical expressions for the time-averaged square of the 4-acceleration of the charge, as well as for the averaged values of any quantities periodic in the time of the reference frame. Expressions for the integral power of scattered radiation, which is proportional to the time-averaged square of the 4-acceleration of the charge, and for the integral scattering cross section, which is the ratio of the power of scattered radiation to the intensity of incident radiation, are obtained for an arbitrary inertial reference frame. An expression for the scattering cross section, which coincides with the known results at the circular and linear polarizations of the incident waves and describes the case of elliptic polarization of the incident wave, is obtained for the reference frame where the charged particle is on average at rest. An expression for the scattering cross section including relativistic effects and the nonzero drift velocity of a particle in this system is obtained for the laboratory reference frame, where the initial velocity of the charged particle is zero. In the case of the circular polarization of the incident wave, the scattering cross section in the laboratory frame is equal to the Thompson cross section.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31025337@JETP_LETTERS

Our hypothesis was based on experimental data, which raised the idea of a finite formation time for the produced medium. At the RHIC energy and in low-density corona region, this time reaches about 2 fm/c. Following this hypothesis, the nuclear modification factor R  AA  at high p  t  should be independent on particle momentum, and the azimuthal anisotropy of high p  t  particles, v 2, should be finite. A separate prediction held that, at the LHC energy, the formation time in the corona region should be about 1 fm/c. New LHC data show that R  AA  is not flat and is rising with p  t . We add to our original hypothesis an assumption that a fast parton traversing the produced medium loses the fixed portion of its energy. A shift of about 7 GeV from the original power law p −6 production cross section in pp explains well all the observed R  AA  dependencies. The shift of about 7 GeV is also valid at the RHIC energy.

The lack of ARPES data for every cuprate family precludes an agreement as to its structure, doping and temperature dependence and the role of charge ordering. No approach has been developed yet to address the issue theoretically, and we limit ourselves by the phenomenological analysis of the experimental data. We argue that, in the Fermi-liquid-like regime ubiquitous in underdoped cuprates, the spectrum consists of holes on the Fermi arcs and an electronic pocket in contrast to the idea of the Fermi surface reconstruction via charge ordering. At high temperatures, the electrons are dragged by holes while at lower temperatures they get decoupled. The longstanding issue of the origin of the negative Hall coefficient in YBCO and Hg1201 at low temperature is resolved: the electronic contribution prevails, as its mobility becomes temperature independent, while the mobility of holes, scattered by the shortwavelength charge density waves, decreases.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=31074805@JETP_LETTERS

Strong enhancement of the Néel temperature T N was observed at pressures above 20 GPa associated with the structural transformation. The highest value of T N is about 130 K which is almost five times larger than the value at ambient pressure (about 27 K). It was suggested that the high value of T N appears due to redistribution of Fe ions over 3f and 2d tetrahedral sites of the langasite structure. In this case, the short Fe-O distances and favorable Fe-O-Fe bond angles create conditions for strong superexchange interactions between iron ions, and effective two-dimensional (2D) magnetic ordering appears in the (ab) plane.

Such waves can form vortices called scroll waves, which result in the onset of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The dynamics of scroll waves is affected by the presence of inhomogeneities, which, in a very general way, can be of (i) ionic type; i.e., they affect the reaction part, or (ii) conduction type, i.e., they affect the diffusion part of an RD-equation. We demonstrate, for the first time, by using a state-of-the-art, anatomically realistic model of the pig heart, how differences in the geometrical and biophysical nature of such inhomogeneities can influence scroll-wave dynamics in different ways. Our study reveals that conduction-type inhomogeneities become increasingly important at small length scales, i.e., in the case of multiple, randomly distributed, obstacles in space at the cellular scale (0.2–0.4 mm). Such configurations can lead to scroll-wave break up. In contrast, ionic inhomogeneities affect scroll-wave dynamics significantly at large length scales, when these inhomogeneities are localized in space at the tissue level (5–10 mm). In such configurations, these inhomogeneities can attract scroll waves, by pinning them to the heterogeneity, or lead to scroll-wave breakup.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29463774@JETP_LETTERS

Under certain conditions, the non-Abelian vortex can become infinitely thin and can be interpreted as a critical ten-dimensional superstring. In addition to four translational moduli, the non-Abelian vortex under consideration carries six orientational and size moduli. The vortex moduli dynamics are described by a twodimensional sigma model with the target space ℝ4 × Y 6, where Y 6 is a non-compact Calabi–Yau conifold. The closed string states that emerge in four dimensions (4D) are identified with hadrons of 4D bulk N= 2 QCD. It turns out that most of the states arising from the ten-dimensional graviton spectrum are non-dynamical in 4D.

These plateaus are assumingly attributed to subharmonics of the superconducting gap and are due to multiple Andreev reflection and strong quasiparticle heating, which occur in the nonequilibrium region of a wire. The plateaus indicate the coexistence of superconductivity and dissipation in these wires.

The theoretical analysis is performed with our unified approach based on the tight-binding method and boundary conditions obtained for it. This approach makes it possible to take into account a complex nonparabolic and anisotropic spectrum of normal excitations in unconventional superconducting materials and their multiband character, as well as unusual types of symmetries of the superconducting order parameter in them. The possibility of a semiclassical description in the case of intraorbital superconducting pairing is demonstrated. The method of calculations and their results are presented for the conductivities of junctions between a normal metal and unconventional superconducting materials, as well as for the Josephson current. Comparison with the experiment for the junction with FeBS is performed and indicates the presence of the unusual s± symmetry of the order parameter.

This underlies the spin-polaron nature of fermion quasiparticles in cuprate HTSCs. The Cooper instability with respect to the d-wave symmetry of the order parameter is revealed for an ensemble of such quasiparticles.

Our results reveal that the compressive strain has much influence on the band gap of the vdW heterostructures and the band gap monotonically increases from 1.330 to 1.629 eV. The results also imply that electrons are likely to transfer from WS2 to SiC monolayer due to the deeper potential of SiC monolayer. Interestingly, by applying a vertical external electric field, the results present a parabola-like relationship between the band gap and the strength. As the E-field changes from to −0.50 +0.20 V/Å, the band gap first increases from zero to a maximum of about 1.90 eV and then decreases to zero. The significant variations of band gap are owing to different states of W, S, Si, and C atoms in conduction band and valence band.

It is shown that the region of optical isotropization is observed in polarized light in the temperature range of 570–620 K. In this case, the birefringence (Δn) decreases and disappears (together with the image of the domain structure) for the [100] directions. The region of optical isotropization in the [111] directions is characterized by the disappearance of the image of the domain structure and by the existence of individual regions with partial quenching. The domain structure in the [110] directions remains distinguished against the background of a significant decrease in Δn in the indicated temperature range. The region of isotropization is also manifested in the temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the dielectric response and is determined by the isotropic character of the conductivity in the range of 570–620 K. The bulk conductivity has a thermally activated character with activation energies E  a  = 50−60 meV at T < 500 K and E  a  = 700−900 meV for T > 620 K. The low-frequency dispersion of the dielectric response is determined by the Maxwell–Wagner mechanism and is due to an increase in the ionic conductivity at temperatures above 620 K.

The method is based on a direct, without any use of the perturbation theory, solution of the Dyson equation with the mass operator Σ(ε) = Σ0 + δΣPC(ε) for finding the single-particle energies and Z-factors. In its turn, they are used as an input for finding different PC corrections to the DMD values.

Saliti, M.G. Tamba, S.N. Sprunt, C. Welch, G.H. Mehl, A. Jakli, and J.T. Gleeson [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 217801 (2016)] to explain their experimental observation of the unprecedentedly large shift of the nematic–isotropic transition temperature is discussed. The proposed interpretation is based on singular longitudinal fluctuations of the nematic order parameter. Since these fluctuations are governed by the Goldstone director fluctuations, they exist only in the nematic state. External magnetic field suppresses the singular longitudinal fluctuations of the order parameter (similarly as is the case for the transverse director fluctuations, although with a different scaling over the magnetic field). The reduction of the fluctuations changes the equilibrium value of the magnitude of the order parameter in the nematic state. Therefore, it leads to additional (with respect to the mean field contribution) fluctuation shift of the nematic–isotropic transition temperature. Our mechanism works for any nematic liquid crystals, however the magnitude of the fluctuation shift increases with decrease in the Frank elastic moduli. Since some of these moduli supposed to be anomalously small for so-called bent-core or dimer nematic liquid crystals, just these liquid crystals are promising candidates for the observation of the predicted fluctuation shift of the phase transition temperature.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29486793@JETP_LETTERS

It is established that the adsorption of propylene on Ni(111) atomic terraces at room temperature results in the dehydration of propylene molecules with the formation of single-atomic carbon chains and in the complete dissociation of propylene at the edges of atomic steps with the subsequent diffusion of carbon atoms below the surface. The annealing of such a sample at 500°С leads to the formation of multilayer graphene islands both from surface atomic chains and by the segregation of carbon atoms collected in the upper nickel atomic layers. The process of formation of an epitaxial graphene monolayer until the complete filling of the nickel surface is controllably observed. Atomic defects seen on the graphene surface are interpreted as individual nickel atoms incorporated into graphene mono- or bivacancies.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29487171@JETP_LETTERS

The same-spin edge states propagate in opposite directions on different sides of the strip and do not mix by tunneling. The interaction with impurities results in interedge same-spin backscattering. At low temperatures, the localization occurs and the conductance of a long wire vanishes. We study this localization in a numerical model of localized scatterers. The localization length is found to be exponentially long with respect to the strip width. The intraedge inelastic forward scattering destroys the coherence.

The nonzero spin polarization of nuclei causing the initial observed Overhauser shift is due the relaxation of the nonequilibrium spin polarization of electrons into the nuclear subsystem near electron paramagnetic resonance owing to the hyperfine interaction. The measured relaxation time of nuclear spins near the unity filling factor is (530 ± 30) min at the temperature T = 0.5 K.

Two-dimensional plasmons couple strongly to the radiative modes of this dielectric waveguide. It is shown that, as a result of the competition between collisional and radiative processes, a family of eight quasi-stationary normal modes arises. Six of them decay carrying energy to infinity. The two remaining plasmon-polariton modes are nonradiative. One of these modes, the TM-type plasmon polariton, in the limiting case where retardation is disregarded corresponds to the conventional longitudinal two-dimensional plasmon. The other mode, the TE-type plasmon polariton, exists only for a finite thickness of the substrate. All of them are characterized by different dispersion relations of the complex frequency ω(q) = Reω + iImω and differ in both polarization (longitudinal and transverse) and symmetry with respect to the direction of decay (symmetric and asymmetric). The latter modes decay slowly, propagating into free space to plus or minus infinity. The conditions under which the Q factors of certain modes are arbitrarily high are found. In this case, Imω(q 0) = 0, and dissipative losses in the two-dimensional electron gas are compensated by external sources. As a result, the reflection coefficient for a plane wave whose angle of incidence is determined by the vector q 0 vanishes.@https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=21871557@JETP_LETTERS

We estimated parameters of both models by doing optical mapping and fluorescent staining of cardiac cell samples grown on polymer fiber substrate. Both models gave reasonable estimations, but predicted different behaviors of the anisotropy ratio (ratio of the highest and lowest wave velocities) after addition of the suppressor of sodium channels such as lidocaine.

The variational approach allows obtaining more accurate values of the core self-energy in comparison to those found in the London approximation (including its changes with the growth of the vortex lattice density) and gives a more adequate picture of the interactions between vortices and of their interaction with the surface. The formula determining a correction to the London expression for the magnetic flux related to vortices in the film is derived. The comparison of the calculations performed using these two models demonstrates that the vortex core structure provides an important contribution if the film thickness is d < 50ξ.

At present, studies of real compounds by means of dynamical mean-field theory employ an approximate form of the Coulomb interaction which breaks the rotational symmetry, leading, in particular, to considerable overestimation of the Curie-Weiss temperature. The obtained temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and Curie-Weiss temperature for the three-band model are in good agreement with the exact solution.

In this case, the behavior of cross sections and distributions of secondary particles are determined by distributions of partons (constituents of the initial proton) carrying only a small fraction x of the momentum of the initial protons. It has been shown that not only the radius of the interaction but also characteristic transverse momenta of particles k t increase with the energy. A model has been developed for the simultaneous description of soft (with low k t values) and hard (with the production of jets of particles with high k t values) interactions; this model provides a continuous smooth transition between them. The possibility of the measurement of the parton density for very small x values at the LHC has been considered.

The applied high pressure leads to the rapid suppression of the AFM phase, which completely vanishes at P > 2 GPa. In La0.82Ba0.18CoO3, the degree of instability of the AFM phase with respect to the high pressure is appreciably higher than that in the related compounds with the ferromagnetic ground state.

Whether one can detect the rotation of the vacuum or not depends on its properties. If the vacuum is fully relativistic at all scales, Mach’s principle should work and one cannot distinguish the rotation: in the rotating Universe + vacuum, the co-rotating bucket will have a flat surface (not concave). However, if there are “quantum gravity” effects, which violate Lorentz invariance at high energy, then the rotation will become observable. This is demonstrated by analogy in condensed-matter systems, which consist of two subsystems: superfluid background (analog of vacuum) and “relativistic” excitations (analog of matter). For the low-energy (long-wavelength) observer the rotation of the vacuum is not observable. In the rotating frame, the “relativistic” quasiparticles feel the background as a Minkowski vacuum; i.e., they do not feel the rotation. Mach’s idea of the relativity of rotational motion does indeed work for them.

Below T0 ≈ 50 K, the magnetoresistance for the directions of the field in the plane of the layers (ab plane) increases sharply, whereas the transverse magnetoresistance (B ∥ c) becomes negative. The results confirm the possibility of an electron phase transition to a collective state at T0. The negative magnetoresistance (at B ∥ c) below T0 is explained by the magnetic-field-induced suppression of two-dimensional weak localization. The positive magnetoresistance (at B ∥ ab) is explained by the effect of the magnetic field on the spectrum of electronic states.

This leads to the appearance of an effective gyromagnetic ratio for an atomic ensemble, which can be defined as the ratio of the average magnetic moment to the average angular momentum. Characteristically, this quantity is not a constant, but rather depends on the populations of the hyperfine sublevels. States of an ensemble of atoms occupying their ground level in which the effective gyromagnetic ratio is zero are of much interest. Here, one of such states is considered by the example of alkali metal 87Rb. The main idea is to suggest a method for preparing states with zero effective gyromagnetic ratio by means of two-frequency pumping of a saturated alkali-metal vapor in a cell containing a buffer gas. It is noteworthy that, according to calculations, correlation between the two fields is not required for attaining this goal.

Fluctuation electromagnetic effects increase strongly near this resonance even in the presence of dissipation in the system. The resonance occurs at distances of the particle from the surface d < d0R(3/4ε″1(ω1)ε″2 (ω2))1/3 (where ε″i(ωi) is the imaginary part of the dielectric function of the particle or the medium at the frequency of a surface phonon or plasmon polariton ωi), when the rotation frequency coincides with poles in the photon generation rate at Ω ≈ ω1 + ω2. These poles are due to the multiple scattering of electromagnetic waves between the particle and surface under conditions of the anomalous Doppler effect. These poles exist even in the presence of dissipation. At d < d0, depending on the particle rotation frequency, the Casimir force can change sign; i.e., the attraction of the particle to the surface changes to repulsion.

Minima of the longitudinal resistance have been observed corresponding to the quantum Hall effect of composite fermions with quantum numbers p = 1, 2, 3, and 4. Minima with p = 3 disappear in magnetic fields below 7 T, which may be a consequence of the intersection or even merging of the quantum levels of the composite fermions with different orientations of the pseudo-spin, i.e., those belonging to different valleys. We have also observed minima of the longitudinal resistance at filling factors ν = 4/5 and 4/11, which may be due to the formation of the second generation of the composite fermions.

In this work, using Raman and synchrotron Mössbauer nuclear forward scattering (NFS) spectroscopies, iron-containing magnesium–silicate perovskite (Mg, Fe)SiO3 (10% Fe) has been studied in the cryogenic temperature range of 35–300 K and at high pressures up to 48 GPa, which are created in diamond anvil cells. The analysis of NFS spectra has indicated that iron ions are in a nonmagnetic (para- or diamagnetic) state in the entire region of temperatures and pressures and the electronic properties can be controlled by means of the quadrupole splitting parameter. It has been found that an increase in the pressure and a decrease in the temperature are accompanied by a significant increase in the parameter Δ from 2 mm/s to ~4 mm/s, which indicates that the electronic state of Fe2+ ions changes. The maximum Δ value has been observed at P > 20 GPa, but the pressure behavior of a transition strongly depends on the temperature. Possible mechanisms of the transition have been discussed.

One-dimensional potential modulation is imposed on the two-dimensional electron gas by means of a set of metal strips formed on the planar surface of Hall bars. The dependences of the differential resistance rxx on the magnetic field B < 0.5 T are studied at a temperature T = 1.6 K in lattices with a period of a ≈ 200nm. It is shown that periodic oscillations in rxx(1/B) occur in such lattices under the action of a current-induced Hall field due to Zener tunneling between Landau levels. Interference is found between Zener oscillations and commensurability oscillations of rxx in two-dimensional electron systems with one-dimensional periodic modulation. The experimental results are qualitatively explained by the role of Landau bands in nonlinear transport at large filling factors.

The sizes and shapes of formed crystal grains have been estimated statistically. The results indicate that the mechanism of nucleation occurs throughout the entire considered temperature range. The crystallization of the system at low supercooling levels occurs through a mononuclear scenario. A high concentration of crystal nuclei formed at high supercooling levels (i.e., at temperatures comparable to and below the glass transition temperature Tg) creates the semblance of the presence of branched structures, which is sometimes erroneously interpreted as a signature of phase separation.

Linear magnetization effects include an effect similar to nonreciprocal birefringence, as well as reciprocal and nonreciprocal rotation of the plane of polarization, caused by the inhomogeneity of the magnetic moment. It has been shown that an effect caused by the equilibrium spin current can appear in the considered medium. This effect is determined either by the inhomogeneity of the spin current or by the spatial dispersion of a wave. The effect associated with the spatial dispersion of the wave is linear in its wave vector and is similar to nonreciprocal birefringence. The effect associated with the inhomogeneity of the spin current describes the rotation of the plane of polarization, which, however, can occur in the system with zero average magnetization.

Light nanosources based on resonant perovskite nanoparticles are of particular interest. However, perovskites with such a composition demonstrate the light-induced segregation of anions, which leads to a reversible dynamic rearrangement of the optical properties of a material and photoluminescence spectra. In this work, the photoinduced process of change in optical properties in resonant hybrid perovskite nanoparticles with a mixed anion composition (MAPbBr1.5I1.5, where MA = NH3CH3 +) has been studied. Comparison with a similar process in a perovskite thin film with a similar composition has shown that the photoinduced migration of halogen ions in a nanoparticle occurs cyclically. This is due to the competition of two processes: the concentration of ions near the boundaries of the particle and migration caused by the gradient of the density of light-generated electron–hole pairs. This effect in resonant nanoparticles makes it possible to obtain optically tunable nanoantennas.

We demonstrate that liquid–gel phase transition is cooperative effect of the three major interactions: inter-lipid van der Waals attraction, steric repulsion and hydrophobic tension. The model explicitly shows that temperature-dependent inter-lipid steric repulsion switches the system from liquid to gel phase when the temperature decreases. The switching manifests itself in the increase in lateral compressibility of the lipids as the temperature decreases, making phase with smaller area more preferable below the transition temperature. The model gives qualitatively correct picture of abrupt change at transition temperature of the area per lipid, membrane thickness and volume per hydrocarbon group in the lipid chains. The calculated dependence of phase transition temperature on lipid chain length is in quantitative agreement with experimental data. Steric repulsion between the lipid molecules is shown to be the only driver of the phase transition, as van der Waals attraction and hydrophobic tension are weakly temperature dependent.

In the case of common metals the Landau–Fermi liquid theory demonstrates that the differential conductivity is a symmetric function of bias voltage V. This is because the particle-hole symmetry is conserved in the Landau–Fermi liquid state. When a strongly correlated Fermi system turns out to be near the topological fermion condensation quantum phase transition, its Landau–Fermi liquid properties disappear so that the particle-hole symmetry breaks making the differential tunneling conductivity to be asymmetric function of V. This asymmetry can be observed when a strongly correlated metal is in its normal, superconducting or pseudogap states. We show that the asymmetric part of the dynamic conductance does not depend on temperature provided that the metal is in its superconducting or pseudogap states. In normal state the asymmetric part diminishes at rising temperatures. Under the application of magnetic field the metal transits to the Landau–Fermi liquid state and the differential tunneling conductivity becomes a symmetric function of V. These findings are in good agreement with recent experimental observations.

The effect originates from the fact that, in the presence of the Rashba/Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman splitting, the electron velocity is not a conserved quantity and contains a contribution oscillating at the frequency determined by the spin gap. The phenomenon is similar to the Zitterwebegung of relativistic particles. Trembling motion of individual electrons can be phase-synchronized by initializing the electrons in the same spin states and detected as a macroscopic high-frequency electric current which is maintained in the system until the electron spin coherence is lost. We also show that the amplitude of such a coherent Zitterbewegung current is increased when its frequency matches the plasmon frequency.

A recently developed method makes it possible to intricately search for such parameters using a formula for the efficiency of Förster resonance energy transfer, which is the sum of several Gaussians. Another simpler method for the determination of the desired parameters of interconformational transitions has been proposed in this work on the basis of statistical processing of fluctuating tracks of fluorescence of a single donor–acceptor pair attached to a protein molecule.

This expression accurately reproduces the wave vector dependence of the plasmon frequency observed in inelastic X-ray scattering experiments for Nd2 – xCexCuO4. The imaginary part of the charge susceptibility along the triangular path in the Brillouin zone is plotted. It is demonstrated that the spectral weight of the plasmon mode near q = 0 is negligibly low. The calculated frequencies of the plasmon mode for all wave vectors in the Brillouin zone turn out to lie outside the range of damping related to electron−hole excitations. A formula for the charge susceptibility is derived within the t−t′−t″−J model supplemented by the Coulomb interaction operator and three-site terms. The derivation is performed by the Green’s function technique employing the formalism of composite Hubbard operators and the Mori projection method, which have proved themselves in the analysis of collective spin excitations. The used Fourier transform of the Coulomb interaction corresponds to the monolayer model with a spatially periodic structure, which is embedded in a three-dimensional crystal lattice.

Pentagraphene is the recently predicted two-dimensional allotropic modification of carbon, in which the С–С bonds form only pentagons, whereas the hexagons characteristic of carbon nanostructures are absent. It is found that the thermally activated rotation of one С–С bond by an angle of 45° initiates the formation of а defect region, which does not remain localized and rapidly propagates over the whole sample, leading eventually to the total destruction of the sample structure. Nevertheless, the probability of such rotation turns out to be so small that, even at room temperature, pentagraphene can preserve its structure for a fairly long time.

A theory of coherent and incoherent photon echo (PE) in an external static magnetic field and in the presence of a pulsed magnetic field, which causes oscillations of the PE intensity, is elaborated. It is shown that the periods of oscillations in the echo intensity, the echo duration, and the dimensions of the regions in the inhomogeneous line, where the excited ions are coherent, do not depend on the degree of coherence of the laser pulse and on the external static magnetic field. As follows from the theory, in the case of the coherent excitation of the echo, the amplitude of the intensity oscillations is independent of the external static magnetic field if the inhomogeneous line is symmetric. It is shown that the amplitude of the oscillations at the incoherent excitation of the echo is equal to the autocorrelation function of the distribution function of the transition frequency along the inhomogeneous line with the argument equal to the Zeeman splitting of the optical line in the external magnetic field. In this case, the experimental values of the oscillation amplitude are in good agreement with the calculated values of the autocorrelation function for the total inhomogeneous line in LuLiF4:Er3+ (4I15/2⇒F9/2 transition).

The lines of radiative transitions between free-exciton levels and between the levels of shallow impurity centers are observed. The intensities of these lines exhibit different dependences on temperature and excitation intensity. At temperatures near the temperature of liquid helium (T ~ 5 K), the terahertz radiation spectrum features a broad band (about 18–20 meV wide) with a peak at an energy of about 20–22 meV. This band is apparently associated with radiative transitions of nonequilibrium charge carriers from the states of the continuum to the state of an electron–hole liquid.

The anomalous disappearance of a diffraction pattern is observed in iron in the region of the α → γ phase transition. At repeated heating processes of an as cast sample, this effect becomes less pronounced and it is absent at the heating of iron powder. The observed effects have been assumingly attributed to the formation of small paracrystalline clusters with a large dispersion of the cell parameters in the process of phase transition. The kinetics of formation of clusters is slowed in as cast samples, which leads to the temporal disappearance of the diffraction pattern. These results make it possible to reconsider the atomic processes in the α → γ phase transition in iron.

We performed classical Monte Carlo calculations for large square lattices implying the mobile doped charges and focusing on a case of a small intersite repulsion V ≪ J. The on-site attraction (U < 0) does suppress the antiferromagnetic ordering and gives rise to a checkerboard charge order with the doped charge distributed randomly over a system in the whole temperature range. However, under the on-site repulsion (U > 0) the homogeneous ground state antiferromagnetic solutions of the doped system found in a mean-field approximation are shown to be unstable with respect to a phase separation with the charge and spin subsystems behaving like immiscible quantum liquids. Puzzlingly, with lowering the temperature one can observe two sequential phase transitions: first, an antiferromagnetic ordering in the spin subsystem diluted by randomly distributed charges, then, a charge condensation in the charge droplets. The effects are illustrated by the Monte Carlo calculations of the specific heat and longitudinal magnetic susceptibility.

Stability of such dissipative structure is ensured by the balance between capillary and electrostatic forces and competition between the surface and bulk electric currents. The bulk charge is governed by the applied voltage being generated by the electric field of the cone due to dissociation/associations reactions at its apex. The effect of the physical parameters of the liquid on the microcone structure is elucidated. It is shown that the cone angle cannot exceed a critical value, which is a function of dielectric permittivity of the liquid. The electric current through the cone is found to be proportional to the square of the applied voltage. The obtained results can be applied for analysis of atomization processes of various liquids.

The resistance increases with the field and reaches a broad maximum in fields about 10 T. An anomalous increase in the resistance in weak fields is qualitatively consistent with the suppression of the antilocalization correction to the resistance, and the maximum is qualitatively associated with the classical size effect. Near the maximum at temperatures below 0.8 K, manifestations of reproducible magneto-oscillations of the resistance, which are periodic in field, have been detected. The period of these oscillations is close to a value corresponding to the passage of the flux quantum hc/e through the section of a nanowire. The Fourier analysis also confirms that the oscillations are periodic. This result is similar to the manifestation the Aharonov–Bohm effect caused by conducting surface states of Dirac fermions occupying L-valleys of bismuth.

The studies of dynamics of a resonantly excited polariton gas in the mean field approximation have shown that such condensate state can be formed purely dynamically at excitation by coherent convergent Gaussian light pulses with a large aperture if the active region of the cavity is ahead of the waist of the Gaussian beam. The spatial distribution of polaritons in the formed high-density condensate has sharp edges and large jumps of the violet shift and quasimomentum on these edges prevent its monotonic expansion despite the repulsive interaction between polaritons. For this reason, the further evolution of the condensate is primarily due to the discharge of particles from its boundary and is accompanied by a decrease rather than an increase in the size of the high-density region at the initial stage. Thus, the self-sustained regime of the dynamic compression of the polariton condensate can be maintained for a relatively long time.

In particular, we show that in high magnetic fields, applied along one of the two main crystallographic axis, we have 2D electron spectrum, whereas, for directions of high magnetic fields far from the axes, we have 1D electron spectrum. The latter is known to promote non-Fermi-liquid properties. As a result, we expect the existence of Fermi-liquid–non-Fermi-liquid angular crossovers or phase transitions.

The investigation of the phase diagram of the model allows us to find the critical regions in magnetic properties. Then the behavior of the real system in these regions is checked by the ab initio calculations. As an example, we studied the physics of magnetic moment (MM) formation due to substitutions of Si by Fe-atoms or vice versa in the otherwise non-magnetic alloy α-FeSi2. We find that the MM formation is essentially controlled by the interaction of Fe atoms with its next nearest atoms (NNN) and by their particular arrangement. The latter may result in different magnetic states at the same concentrations of constituents. Moreover, one of arrangements produces the counterintuitive result: a ferromagnetism arises due to an increase in Si concentration in Fe1−xSi2+x ordered alloy. The existing phenomenological models associate the destruction of magnetic moment only with the number of Fe–Si nearest neighbors. The presented results show that the crucial role in MM formation is played by the particular local NNN environment of the metal atom in the transition metal-metalloid alloy.

It is shown that, in the case of attraction and q0 = 2pF the first instability manifesting itself with the growth of the interaction strength is the Pomeranchuk instability. This instability appearing in the L = 2 channel gives rise to a second order phase transition to a nematic phase. The Monte Carlo calculations demonstrate that this transition is followed by a sequence of the first and second order phase transitions corresponding to the changes in the symmetry and topology of the Fermi surface. In the case of repulsion and small values of q0, the first transition is a topological transition to a state with the spontaneously broken rotational symmetry, namely, corresponding to the nucleation of L ≃ π(pF/q0 − 1) small hole pockets at the distance pF − q0 from the center and the deformation of the outer Fermi surface with the characteristic multipole number equal to L. At q0 → 0, when the model under study transforms to the two-dimensional Nozières model, the multipole number characterizing the spontaneous deformation is L → ∞, whereas the infinitely folded Fermi curve acquires the Hausdorff dimension D = 2 which corresponds to the state with the fermion condensate.

A significant increase in the transition temperature TN to an antiferromagnetic state with the pressure from 48.2 K at atmospheric pressure to 76 K at a pressure of 5.3 GPa has been revealed. The initial pressure derivative is dTN/dP = 4.83 K/GPa. It has been found that the parameter α = d(logTN)/d(logV) = −6.6 ± 0.1 is significantly different from the value α = −10/3 ≈ −3.3 (Bloch relation), which is typical of numerous antiferromagnetic insulators—transition- metal oxides and fluorides. The volume jump at the magnetic transition point has been estimated. The necessity of direct dilatometric measurements of the volume has been justified.

Both quantities have been found to obey the thermally activated dependence (Arrhenius law) with close activation energies. This result indicates a relation between the quantities and confirms a hypothesis that the observed dynamics of the domain structure originates from the dynamical screening of the spontaneous electric field of domains by charges in the doping layer.

The magnetic phase transition in DyF3 is accompanied by a considerable change in the character of fluctuations of the magnetic moments of dysprosium ions, which affect the spin kinetics of 3Не in contact with the substrate. Significant changes in the relaxations rates of the longitudinal and transverse magnetizations of 3Не have been discovered in the region of magnetic ordering of the solid matrix.

It is possible that the atomically smooth disorder produced by the corrugated graphene does not destroy the superfluidity even in a very thin film, where the system can be considered as quasi two-dimensional topological material. This will allow us to study the effect of disorder on different classes of the 2 + 1 topological materials: the chiral 3He-A with intrinsic quantum Hall effect and the time reversal invariant planar phase with intrinsic spin quantum Hall effect. In the limit of smooth disorder, the system can be considered as a Chern mosaic, i.e., a collection of domains with different values of Chern numbers. In this limit, the quantization of the Hall conductance is determined by the percolated domain, while the density of the fermionic states is determined by the edge modes on the boundaries of the finite domains. This system can be useful for the general consideration of disorder in the topological matter.

The phenomenon of spatial separation of the spin components of the polariton condensate upon pumping with a coherent superposition of two beams with opposite circular polarizations and orbital angular momenta is observed. The key factors for the observation of this effect are the lateral anisotropy of the microcavity that causes a splitting between the linear components of the polariton ground state and the occurrence of opposite orbital angular momenta for the two spin components of the condensate. The experimental results are in qualitative agreement with the theoretical model of the phenomenon developed in JETP Lett. 104, 827 (2016).

The EPR spectrum consists of a single Lorentzian line due to the exchange-coupled system of spins of Cu2+ and Mn3+ ions. It has been established experimentally that the g-factor in the paramagnetic region is strongly anisotropic and anomalously small, which is not typical of the exchange-coupled system of spins of Cu2+ and Mn3+ ions. At a temperature of 150 K, the g-factors along the crystallographic a, b, and c axes are 2.04, 1.96, and 1.87, respectively. Such small effective g-factor values can be due to the effect of the anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya exchange interaction between the spins of Cu2+ and Mn3+ ions directed along the a axis. The presence of two Cu2+ and Mn3+ Jahn–Teller ions occupying four nonequivalent positions in the crystal is responsible for the absence of the inversion center. It is found that the behavior of the magnetostriction of Cu2MnBO5 is not typical of transition-metal crystals but is closer to the behavior of crystals containing rare-earth ions.

In these aims, a model of coupling of an order parameter with other degrees of freedom is used. The coupling of magnetic order parameters with long-wave acoustic phonons, in the presence of the nonsingular parts of the bulk and shear moduli, a first-order transition occurs, participle near the transition the heat capacity and the compressibility remain finite, if the heat capacity becomes infinite in the system disregarding the acoustic phonons. The role of the Frenkel heterophase fluctuations is discussed. The impurity effect shows that, for some phases, the heat capacity of the system remains continuous and finite at the transition point. It is supposed that the transition is progressively smoothed by these fluctuations at the application of the magnetic field.
